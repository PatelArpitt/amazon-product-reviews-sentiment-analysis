Word Shark,Great Mouse From Logitech,"If you are looking for a good all-around mouse that will work well for gaming, web surfing and office work, you could do a lot worse than the Logitech G502 Hero. Very smooth tracking, with several resolutions for any situation/screen size.Comes with a bunch of little weights that you can install by flipping back the bottom cover, so you can make it feel more or less weighty. The cover on the bottom is held in place by a magnet and simply flips open to reveal the weight compartment.The RBG element is just a glowing 'G' situated on top of the mouse, so don't expect too much in that department. You can download Logitech's software to control the light colour, if that is important to you. Otherwise, it just cycles through the spectrum.I have fairly large hands and this mouse feels just right for me size-wise. People with small hands may want to search for something else though.Overall, highly recommended!","November 21, 2022",5
Blackbox,Good product but missing a few opportunities,"Things I did not like:1. Double Click - Massive amount of reviews saying that double click was a major concern and problematic issue. Caused by small amounts of corrosion overtime in the click mechanism. (the plates touch when clicked which sends an electrical signal and after lots of clicking, a small amount of corrosion is caused which causes double click). Some people experienced this issue within a few months to years. People that experienced this after warranty were not compensated and voiced themselves in forums.2. Software kinks I wish were worked out but were never worked out even after buying the product years after it's conception and release. Here's the issue. Logitech gaming software won't recognize the G502 Hero unless the software is running in administrator mode but Logitech gaming software won't start up during computer start-up if the program is set as ""run as administrator"". Very contradicting when I want all my programs to run together on start-up. Weirdly, it recognizes my Logitech G633 headset without administrator mode. In the end, the software optimization needs work, and is not a seamless experience, and lots of bugs to work out instead of forgetting about the problem.3. No scroll wheel RGB, which was a defining feature for the Razer which made me pick it over the G502. Even though the lights had actual function in the G502, the light up middle scroll wheel in the Razer was so defining and stylish that I would pick it over the Logitech. I only need around 2 sensitivities, and the sensitivity clutch allows me to ""on the fly"" switch to a slower speed so the side lined RGB in the 502 were not that useful although sometimes helpful.4. No upper hump like Razer products. Depending on whose using the mouse, for claw grip or finger tip grip, the upper hump was very supportive, without this, it feels like your hand is somewhat floating and it is somewhat kind of straining. I would say that the Razer design is more comfortable and fits like a glove compared to the G502. G502 is recommended really only for palm grips when talking about an ""enthusiast fit"".Things I liked:1. Click - The click is somewhat light, but it feels and sounds very light.2. Stylish sleek design, definitely depends on the eye of the beholder but nonetheless it's a stylish product.3. Software - when working (on administrator mode), it's a very streamlined experience. As you click software that pre-determines the rgb or profile, it will immediately change, unlike the Razer peripherals which takes a fading approach that changes the RGB a couple seconds slower.4. Scroll wheel is somewhat of a good default click, and the option to change to free-wheel spin is nice but I rarely ever use it5. Sensor - The sensor is very accurate and you won't have any issues using this device in that area. My shots were accurate and precise.6. Edge to edge left and right mouse buttons - If you are able to notice, the left and right click buttons do not go edge to edge, this is a good thing. On the razer mouse, the buttons go edge to edge which sometimes gets in the way of the ring finger placement when using the scroll-wheel middle click. This rubbery edge can be a nice placement for certain situations without accidentally clicking the right click. On the Razer, this is something you have to watch out for and in the middle of a fire fight, I've clicked the middle button on the Razer while accidentally pressing the right click.","September 6, 2021",3
Kenny,This is my second one.,"I bought a G502 X, retuened it and got another G502 instead because although the switches need improvement this was on for $50 Cad at the time.The 40g in the difference (1/3 of the weight of a G502 without weights) is simply too much of a difference for me.I used to use a Razor deathadder.... I don't wanna go back to a lightweight twitchy mouse. I want a heavy mouse that's slower and won't make me overshoot... It's precise and methodical.","November 7, 2022",4
Jess,"Over all, a great mouse, with minor improbable aspects","I really like this mouse largely because of the number of programmable buttons. When I’m playing fps’s, I like to program my melee and supers onto mouse buttons so I can focus on movement with my left hand on the keyboard and attacks with my right hand on the mouse, so this is really useful for me.DPS: the dps buttons are the two the just left of the left click button, and you can go up or down with with those. There’s a handy set of three rgb lights on the left of the mouse which show you which dpi setting you’re on, you can adjust those settings with the Logitech driver to whatever Dpi levels you need and you get four options you can set. The light come on when you change your dps but turn off after a little bit. I haven’t tried programming those buttons in game yet, so I don’t know if you were to program one to an in game action if it would also change the dps at the same time.Ergonomics/comfort: the mouse is quite comfortable for me, and I have a palm grip. I’ve also never noticed any comfort problems with other mice, but nonetheless, this one is still comfortable. The texture on the sides are fine with me, but my boyfriend doesn’t like the one on the right side, he’s got a weird thing though with textures. I don’t have that problem and actually find the texture nice as it’s not that super smooth almost slippery feeling texture. The scroll wheel has a weird texture that almost feels slippery in a metallic way, if that makes sense? It is grooved as well, though. The mouse comes with adjustable weights you can add, but it’s honestly already pretty heavy, IMO. I didn’t add any of the weights. It’s not heavy to the point of being a problem though.Usability: The G-shift button isn’t super easy for me to reach without shifting my hand forward a bit, but I also have pretty small hands. It’s not so far that it’s a hassle to shift a little either, but the issue with the g-shift button is that you have to hold it while pressing whatever other button you’re trying to access, so it’s a little more difficult. It would probably be easier if you could set it to a toggle weather than holding it, I haven’t tried to do that, but maybe I will see if it’s an option. Again, can’t comment on programming the dpi buttons in game, but you can change the button programming in the Logitech driver too, so I imagine it’s possible to change things around if you want to have something else change your dpi. Now, the scroll wheel. It’s not my favourite, and probably my least favourite aspect of this mouse. As I mentioned above, the texture is smooth-slippery feeling, but I haven’t had any noticeable difficulties with grip on it, and I’m sure the grooves help with that. The grooves are how I feel that the wheel is in fact scrolling for me, without the grooves, it would feel even weirder. You can change the scroll wheel to have the notched roll or a smooth roll, and that’s with the button just below the scroll wheel. I leave it on the notched one or it can be difficult to control, especially if you’re scrolling to switch weapons in game. If you’re scrolling on a page, getting it to register the continuous scroll is kinda hard, it doesn’t always work, but the continuous scroll isn’t something super important to me. I haven’t tested the side scrolling mechanism, tried to but couldn’t find somewhere to use it. Someone previously commented that using it causes the two top click buttons to click down, but I didn’t notice that while pressing for the side scroll, either direction, so it doesn’t seem like that’s a problem for me. I don’t have any problems with the mouse registering movement when I pick it up to move or shift it, but I think I also naturally lift it pretty high, in terms of mouse lifting, but I think that’s also and adjustable setting.Aesthetic: I like the look, the G is the only part that lights up with rgb, but I like the look of rgb lights, so I would have liked more lights on the mouse in visible locations since the G is covered by my hand (from the view of my eyes, the view point in the photo is lower and from the side, so it’s visible) while I’m using it. You can also turn off the lights in the driver settings if you want, and choose different colours, patterns, and speeds. I like that I can match the rgb with my Logitech keyboard, but that’s just because they’re the same brand. I know for the keyboard, you can also download custom light colour/patterns that other people have uploaded, I didn’t see that for the mouse too, but could be because I wasn’t looking for it.All in all, I’d definitely recommend this mouse for people who have a gaming style and preferences similar to mine. My only real issue with it is the scroll wheel, and that’s not to the level of being a deal breaker, and I would have also liked some more visible rgb lights on the mouse, but usability and comfort are more important to me than aesthetics, so it’s not something that really bothers me. I didn’t give five stars only because of the scroll wheel and size being slightly large for me (again, I have small hands, so it’s not something that will affect others the same way it does me). If I could give 4.5, I would. As I test things out, I’ll try to remember to come back and update as needed. So far, I’m loving the mouse and the customizability it offers, as well as the comfort of it (again, noting I’ve never had any problems with comfort in terms of mice before). End of the day, would recommend.","July 8, 2020",4
SCOTT M REID,Infinity adjustable,"Adjustable in weight, speed, and scrolling. Bought one for my daughter some time ago and when it came time to replace our desktop mouse, it was the clear choice for comfort and weight that I enjoy in a mouse. And not an insane price either.","December 6, 2022",5

Akif Eren Yilmaz,Deal breaker: scroll wheel rattle,"Heavy mouse, feels firm in hand. Side programmable buttons are usable although it may get tricky due to thumb placement. Rattle from scroll wheel in every movement which made me return the mouse, seems to be a common issue.","October 27, 2022",4
Matthew M.,A great successor to the G602,"I had my Logitech G602 for about 6 or 7 years before finally upgrading to the G604. I must say, it's an excellent upgrade, with easier to use and more comfortable thumb buttons, better ""feet"", the toggleable scroll wheel that goes between free spin and weighty... the biggest adjustment was the added bit of weight or ""jiggle"" I'd call it from the scroll wheel, which also offers horizontal scrolling. Otherwise, my hand settled into its natural grip right away. There are some mice with more features, like the ones that let you swap out the thumb button layout, but for me this is perfect.","October 20, 2022",5
Neil Bliss,I don't game ...but...,"It took me a bit to figure it out....but once I got to programming the various extra buttons I was able to have all sorts of applications doing shortcut maneuvers.The item came very quickly and was just what i hoped it would be.

YG,Overall is good. But too heavy compare to my Razer viper,,"November 13, 2022",4
T. Trinh,Great mouse for all PC functions,"Mouse with well-designed comfortable form to hold. The programmable buttons are very useful, not only for gamers, but also for office workers with all the copy/paste/save/open/new file functions at your finger tips literally. Highly recommended.","November 25, 2022",5
Lawr,arrived on time,This mouse is a good one for people with medium or larger sided hands. I have noticed no lag in response time.No negatives for me.,"November 22, 2022",5
Amazon Customer,"Definitely find a better gaming mouse, do research","So at first the mouse seemed fine in build quality. Clicks nice, came with extra weights, feels good. Good latency in the mouse, very responsive.FOR GAMERS THO READ THIS.The scroll wheel is GARBAGE, sometimes when I slightly pick my mouse up to re Center my aim, the scroll wheel is so sensitive that you will always switch to your side arm. I had to just disable scroll when for weapon switching in all my games because of this.  Also if you bind your weapon switch key to the button left of the left mouse button that is super sensitive to and will randomly switch weapons when you pick your mouse up.So that’s why, one star is missing because for a gaming mouse this scroll wheel is legit aids.The second star has to be logitechs absolute ***************** ************ software for there mouse, oh my god. Like what’s the point of running in the background of my system, giving my RAM 75 MBs to run your software if it doesn’t work WELL. By that I mean, if it’s running in the background it never auto detects my games and switches profiles.And I’d say, mid game I open the software to change a key bind, IT ALWAYS DEFAULTS BACK TO DESKTOP LIKE FUUUUUUUUUUUU MAN.Basically, I fell for the meme on this one, everyone says this mouse is good, well it’s okay it feels good, clicks nice, just needs to have a more stiff middle wheel, like this thing spins for a minute if you really give it a rip it’s insane. And the software just needs to auto detect your game, it’s not that hard, I write code and this company is easily worth more than a billion so they can definitely afford the talent to do that simple thing.If this is all you can find for a mouse get it, if not do a hour more of research and spend maybe like 20 bucks more for a nicer package in general.","March 24, 2022",3
Yinghao,Best mouse I've ever had,The weight is the most suitable for me after installing the arrow blocks to the bottom of the mouse. I like the concept.,"November 18, 2022",5
101,Is it Worth it?,"The Logitech G502 Hero feels like a sports car in everything but it’s packaging, and it’s software. The G502 is my first experience with a flagship Logitech mouse; although, I have owned numerous other budget / mid-level mice from the company. As a point of reference, my previous daily driver was the G400s, which lasted me many years. While I appreciate the added buttons and flexibility, weather or not the asking price is worth it, will entirely depend on your needs. As for me, I’m not really sure how to feel about the product.Accuracy is on point, so you need not worry about the sensor. Enhanced functionality is present due to the added side and shift buttons. And then there’s the free wheeling scroll wheel... Look in limited use cases it’s great, but unless you are using it slowly, it tends to be a burden. When the scroll wheel is locked, it is very heavy and shakes the entire mouse when in use. This is an area I think Logitech can, and needs to improve on.I didn’t find a need for the included weights, since my previous daily driver was slightly lighter than the G502. In terms of shape and feel, I’d give it a solid 4/5 for people with small hands. My preferred palm grip is comfortable to use, and I don’t feel as though the shape detracts in any major way from this grip type. The shift button is slightly out of reach, and the overall shape could be a little shorter on the Y axis if you ask me. All in all, it’s comfortable to use.Comes with a 3 year warranty. We’ll just have to wait and see how it stands up to daily use. If past experience is anything to go by, it should last a decent number of years. Logitech’s products have, in my experience, been very long lasting. So here’s hoping the G502 lives up to that expected durability.The unit has on-board memory; although, the software side of things is lacking. The Logitech Gaming Software isn’t the worst piece of third party software I’ve used, but it also isn’t the best. I had to reinstall my software just to get it to recognize my new G502. I feel that Logitech needs to invest more in fleshing out their software offerings. For example: I already own an Orion G810 keyboard, but the only two lighting modes I can sync with the mouse are static colour and pulsating.In conclusion; the scroll wheel is too heavy when not in free scroll mode, I’d like it to be shorter on the Y axis, and the software needs to be made more compelling. My only other gripe is that the packaging is very lackluster; I’ve opened power supply units with nicer packaging than Logitech products. If you are the type of person that would benefit from the extra buttons, and or you simply want that extra level of precision when fine tuning the weight of your device, then this is a good option. For most other users though, I recommend the G203 Prodigy.NOTE: The textured rubber on on the thumb rest gets dirty very easily and needs to be cleaned often.","April 14, 2019",3
Charles Neves,"Sleek, smooth, pure gaming comfort","So, I picked this up because I've been a long time user of the G502 Proteus Core. I bought a laptop for travelling recently and needed a mouse to compliment it, and naturally I gravitated back to what I knew. Logitech mice have been a part of gaming for me for years now, so I knew I was getting quality. I love the ability to add or remove weight, the quick DPI switch buttons and the unlockable scroll wheel (which admittedly I have no use for aside from joyously spinning). Honestly though, I have recently big hands so this mouse is perfect for my needs.","October 3, 2022",5
Doug,"Great mouse, Grip is good, but software and on board memory is a bit jank","All I really play is Call of duty on pc, so sliding, reloading etc I like to have mapped to my mouse. So in the software provided I remapped all of my mouse buttons to keyboard inputs as their is a couple of buttons that are unnameable otherwise.Unfortunately, you have to open the software every time you boot up your pc, have it start on boot, or save it to the on board memory on the mouse it self.The on board memory glitches out from time to time and resets back to factory defaults, opening Logitech G software again does fix it.Overall great mouse, if you have bigger hands but still has quality of life issues that need to be fixed. :)","July 24, 2022",4

Phil,Yes and no,I've had 2 G602 before finally buying a G604. It is the new version of the same mouse but it feels somewhat cheaper quality at first. Gotta admit the sensor does work a lot better and the buttons feel smooth. It's also a little smaller than the G602. Let's see if the scroll wheel will last longer than it used to do with the G602,"September 4, 2022",4
Michael,Cool mouse but bad program,"I switched from a razer DeathAdder to Logitech G502 so to me the mouse feels smaller and not as comfortable. For gaming, it is nice since there are more side buttons and a dpi toggle button to set certain DPI for certain games and for people too lazy to remap each game. But the Logitech program is not as user-friendly as Razer in my opinion. Besides the user interface of the program, the G502 is a better mouse with more side buttons and an option to add weights.","August 2, 2022",4

Bennet,My all-time favourite mouse,"I've used a lot of different mice through the years and the Logitech G502 has solidified itself as my favourite. Mice can be very personal as the comfort of each mice is different for everybody, but for me, the G502 is an extremely comfortable shape that I absolutely love. But there's another reason why I love this mouse so much, it has the perfect amount of buttons for me. As someone who uses multiple desktops and switch between them frequently, I bind short-cuts to swap between them to the mouse buttons which makes things so much more convenient. There's enough buttons for that in addition to having media controls as well. This is the 2nd time I've bought this mouse as my original G502 finally started malfunctioning after about 6 to 7 years of use.To me, this is the perfect general-purpose mouse that is great for any type of gaming (with the exception of FPS games) or productivity. The software is easy to use and lets you change bindings and even save them to the mouse directly to use on other computers. The only people who I would recommend against buying this mouse are avid FPS players. This is by no means an FPS mouse, and I'm sure most will agree it is quite heavy in comparison to other lightweight gaming mice out there. For casual players and other types of gamers, this is a fantastic choice.Logitech has come out with a wireless version recently, but it is significantly more expensive and I wouldn't recommend it unless you really want to cut the wires.  The biggest downside with the wireless version for me is the use of the archaic micro-USB charging cable, if they updated it to use USB-C in the future, I would definitely pick one up.","September 1, 2021",5
DanFromHali,THE mouse for gaming,"I've has several pieces of kit in my day, and have been through several mice. I've had wired, wireless, novelty, mmo. I've had a a mouse that lights up, a mouse that you can customize the layout of. There is a mouse for everything. Recently I had purchased some used equipment, and with it, they had the Logitech Performance MX wireless mouse. Make no mistake about it, it's a fine mouse. But relying on battery life and a wireless adaptor wore me down.My roommate recommended me buy the 502, as it was what he uses. It has less bells and whistles than other higher end names, but he says it is super reliable. So I bought it.The MX, I had a hard time playing with. Sometimes the mouse would be unresponsive, other times it felt like the sensetivity was just... off, regardless of how much I tweaked it. So it was time to try something new. I do enjoy logitech. My headset, and keyboard are both Logitech. I don't think I have ever not had a PC with a logitech keyboard and mouse. They've been a standard for a reason.Luckily, the G502 came in record time. To make use of all of its functions it forces you to download the GHUB software, which isn't compatible with the software that I use for my keyboard. It won't let you download it if you have Gaming Software (A Logitech APP) installed. So I uninstalled it, installed GHUB and than re-installed the LGS.The LED's on the mouse are totally customizeable, and the colors and pasterns are able to sync with my headset with just the push of a button in GHUB.Performance-wise, this mouse is solid. It feels durable, and as a gamer that likes heavier equipment (The reason I like using an XBOX controller over say a PS4 or Switch controller), I like that you are able to add about 4, 3.6kg weights in to the base of the mouse.  It's not much, but with 3 of these in, the sway of the mouse just feels right in an fps game.All in all, this is the perfect mouse. If you are buying anything more expensive than this, you are just buying for aesthetic. This has all of the functionality you need in a gaming mouse, without needing access to mmo hotkeys that an mmo mouse. If that's what you're using it for, you are better off going with a Razer, as they have the best mmo options on the market right now. But if you are playing COD, CS:GO, or Overwatch? You aren't going to beat the Logitech G502 Hero","April 14, 2020",5
Steve leroux,Très bon produit,Très bon produit ses comme le site dit elle s'ajuste vraiment à ta vitesse. 3 positions pour la vitesse pour gamer et aussi sur les logiciel autocad Très précis sauf j'aurais dû prendre sans fil hihi,"September 13, 2022",4
Todd S. Lyons,Good mouse all around,"Progammer and Gamer, so I'm very very  picky about my mice since I use them all day. I can't stand wired mice because I dislike the cord-drag, this has been perfect in everyway so far in the first few months.The only caveat I'd like to see them improve is to make a more solid battery cover, as since it's in the palm - you can feel it wiggle slightly under your palm. That's a trade-off with making it easy to pop off for changes,  but I'd much rather it be more secure and harder to pop out, rather than the single-plastic pressure-tip holding it down giving your palm a (very slight!) wobbly feel.It really only matters for very precise/fast aiming, but I play Quake / Widowmaker / Destiny 2 (Scout Rifle), so on a flick you'll have the rear of the mouse wobble/rebound maybe a half millimeter. Trivial for almost everyone, but a very slight problem for twitch sniping in a fast-paced shooter.I solved it by taping it down with some electrical tape, which fixes the wobble entirely, but then you lose the traction of the mouse-surface on your skin, versus too-smooth electrical tape (plus it looks ghetto).","April 21, 2022",5
LRod,Feature rich. A great all-arounder!,"I've been a Logitech enthusiast for decades. And yet I've only ever owned a handful of their products. Why? Because they last for years. All of them are still fully functional.. except for my G500 mouse which has its cord disconnected internally, but can be repaired easily enough.Anyhow, I went completely wireless again and this beauty was the last piece to my setup. And I think I made the right choice.I love that it's similar in size to my G502 Proteus Spectrum, and the slightly raised ""feet"" gives it some extra height. This is perfect as it allows my hand to rest more comfortably on it. The thumb rest was also a selling point for me as it was a feature I didn't know I needed but thoroughly enjoyed having on my G502. It prevents my thumb unnecessarily dragging on my mouse pad, and allows my thumb to relax and rest since I don't have to use it to grip the mouse constantly through long work/play sessions.If there's one thing I'm not overly happy with, it's the G-Keys: I would've preferred the same layout and number of buttons as the oft-mentioned G502. My thumb's long so I find the back two buttons awkwardly positioned and difficult to use freely. I'll probably just deactivate them.So why not buy the G502 Lightspeed instead? There are several reasons actually:1) it's currently CDN$70 more than the G604;2) it lacks Bluetooth connectivity;3) it's rechargeable, which means needing another cord on my desk; and4) as such, it's battery life is questionable, especially with its RGBI love that the G604 only requires a single AA battery, and the reviews seem to confirm its longevity. It also sports the same Hero 16K sensor as the G502. But unlike the G502, it also has Bluetooth connectivity on top of Lightspeed making it more practical.In addition, the stealthy styling, the mat finish, the weight, and the overall feel of the G604 makes this a great all-arounder. I can confidently recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless gaming mouse. Happy shopping!Edit: I was surprised how easy it was to adjust to the G-Keys' positioning, allowing me to take advantage of the back 2 buttons. I use them for cut and paste for work, and as menu hotkeys for games. Five stars!!","September 3, 2020",5
Eric Morin,Love it so far (Updated),"UPDATE: the mouse developed the dreaded false double-clicks issue after a bit over 18 months of 8-12h/day usage (productivity, some gaming).  It drove me nuts.  I could've send it to Logitech to ""fix"" it because it was still under warranty, but I decided to buy new switches and replace them myself.  The mouse design is overly complicated but it's an easy job if you know how to solder.  I still give this mouse a 3/5 because I can't find any mouse that does it all like this one (light gaming and productivity) but these cheap Chinese switches are basically killing what could've been one of the best mouse on the market (unless you're playing fps competitively of course... this isn't the mouse for you).I think the G604 is a very good all around wireless mouse.  For me, it checks all my requirements.  It replaces an ""old"" G700s, a mouse I bought many years ago mostly for gaming/productivity, but I never liked it much because of its very short battery life (in hours!!!).  Eventually I got fed up, removed the battery and used it as a non wireless mouse.  Lately it started to act up, so I looked for a replacement.  I wanted a wireless mouse that I could use for casual gaming and that would also be good for productivity, with programmable side buttons and with a long battery life (i.e. a few months).Comes the G604.  In bluetooth mode, it can last for months (my desktop has bluetooth).  In 2.4 Ghz mode it has the speed for gaming.  Switching between the two take less than a second.  It's definitely heavy, but I'm used to it (it's about the same as the G700s).  The only thing I like a bit less is the heavy metal scroll wheel.  In free mode it's fine, but in the ""notched"" mode I feel it's too noisy.  But I'm getting used to it after a few days...Logitech G Hub isn't the best experience so far though... But it's software, it can improve and I hope it will.I recommend this mouse, but please watch a few review videos before you buy.  This mouse isn't for everyone.  For example, if you are a competitive FPS gamer, it will do, but there are better choices.","May 15, 2020",3

Chris Semenchuk,"Looks solid, but looks are deceiving","I bought this as a replacement for my original G502, which has become worn and gained the dreaded double-click. Despite the ratings, little did I know I was in store for a serious downgrade in quality.1. The cable is now rubber instead of braided.2. The weights are not identical in size - two were slightly larger and hard to put in, while one was slightly smaller and would not stay in place unless the lid was closed.3. The middle mouse button is harder to grip. The grooves are smaller and less pronounced, making it harder to keep a good grip on the scroll wheel.4. Worst of all - the mouse wobbles! Every time I would left- or right-click, the entire mouse would tilt to the left or right, and this is on a flat surface! I've spent the last 5 years using the original G502 without this problem.Safe to say this will be a guaranteed return. Guess I'll be trying mice in a physical store instead of simply expecting the level of quality I used to get from Logitech. If you're reading this, I would recommend you do the same.","November 23, 2022",2
RASHED,Best mouse ever!,"Fits my hand, great performance 😎","October 17, 2022",5
Dylan Sandiford-Boyle,A decent replacement.,"I got this mouse to replace my original G502 because I'd become so used to the shape and features of it. All of which this mouse has. In fact for the price I thought it just was the G502 since it's what came up when I searched for it. But this is not the G502.This is the G502 Hero, and I can tell. While still a good mouse after almost two months of heavy use I've noticed a few issues that I just didn't have with my original.The overall build quality just feels lower. Not by a lot, but enough to be noticable which leads to some of my other issues.The mouse buttons feel squishy. It's hard to describe but it's really noticable, a few times a day I'll stop and find myself just rapid clicking to see if it's the mouse on the verge of dying or something. Something I shouldn't have to do with a 100$ CAD mouse.The scroll wheel is also over sensitive. I play a lot of MMO and strategy games where middle click and drag is really important, but I also have the side flick of the mouse wheel bound to other keys as well. With my other mouse the two never interacted with each other. It never scrolled or flicked when I wanted to click, and vice versa. This one does however.Another albeit a nitpick and a small one, and this may be because of the squishy mouse buttons, is that the left mouse button rests just below the lip of the two top plate(?) Buttons to the left of it. This creates a ledge that's rather annoying/distracting.Overall this is a good mouse, but the issues I'm having that the original G502 (that I also didn't even get new, I got it from a friend) just didn't have, and the fact that I paid more for this one just kind of irk me. I don't know if these are universal issues or if I just have a bad mouse, but I'm probably outside of whatever replacement window period comes with it for issues like these, so I'll review what I've got.","June 1, 2020",3
shinryuken,Not a great mouse...,"I don't know if I just got a defect product, but the mouse literally lags and stops working for a few seconds.  Had to get a refund and bought an Asus mouse instead.  I would definitely suggest you do some research before buying this product.  The mouse is also on the heavier side, so if you're not a fan of a heavy mouse, this probably isn't for you.","October 30, 2022",3
C. Swift,build-quality is going down on these,"I generally like the G502. but it should be noted: I purchased this one to replace one which no longer middle-clicks properly... an unexpected failure after it had already been losing it's anti-friction pads. Now this replacement is built with cheaper parts, such as the obvious switch from the previously used braided cables to this one, with it's thin-rubbery cable. Buyers be aware.","November 2, 2022",3
Mattias,The best mouse around,"Already had one from 5 years ago that recently broke only because it got smashed. Immediately bought a second one and it has held up like a charm. Ergonomic and super comfortable while also being good for gaming. Not the lightest mouse in the world, but I'm not a professional player and the comfortability of the mouse really makes up for the weight. Best mouse in the world, I will never use another mouse.","August 17, 2022",5
LuckyLucy,still the best gaming mouse there is for 50$ sale,"This mouse is 50$ on sale on blackfriday and its definitely still one of the best bang for buck mice out there for gaming and work.Pros:+HIGHLY programmable buttons+Programmable Fun LED (though personally i dont care)+""Drag Clicking""  actually works because the clicks are registered --- my son can drag click + bridge much easier with this mouse heh heh heh .  In comparison, he has slightly less success with the ""glorious D"" mouse.  So yes, he prefers this mouse over the coveted ""glorious"" mouse.+weights are pretty handy for customizing the weighted feel as you move around.  i prefer two weights and my son prefers NO weights.+shoe string style usb cable, not stiff+i actually  reallly like the ""press and hold"" button which instantly changes DPI to any value momentarily until you release it.  great for work/gaming --> i program it to a very low dpi so i can press-hold whenever i want more detailed movement (ex: photoshop sliders) then i release it to go back to normal dpi resolution.Cons:-might be something you may not want but this mouse (even without the weights) is heavy.-no perforations on the surface so if you have sweaty palms, that might be something you dislike about this mouse.-during gameplay, default dpi up/down buttons are right beside the left clicker.  accidental dpi change is annoying --- but no worries?  just reprogram the buttons!overall get this mouse.  VERY good value with the sales (at the time of writing  review its 49.99 cad for black friday but i'm sure other key sale days will have this kind of price tag too).","November 25, 2020",5
"Tech, Dogs, Drums and more",Best mouse I have ever used.,"I have had this for a few months now and LOVE it. I had a previous gaming mouse that was starting to malfunction after about 8 years and took my time picking. First off, the lighting is great with many options from breath, cycle, screen average etc. I am not a huge RGB guy so I just let it cycle.The weight of this mouse is very nice. Lighter than I was expecting but id does come with weights if you like a heavier feel. The fit is great. Very comfortable. I think it is good for palm resters but also claw grip users.I use it for work, but also video editing, FPS gaming and more. You can assign ANY of the buttons to pretty much anything you want from opening applications, macros, keyboard shortcuts, and there is even built in settings for popular applications like Adobe Microsoft products etc.  If you do photo editing you can actualy have specific things for exposure, shadows or other features to fit into your workflow.The buttons feel solid, the G-HUB app has been great and can sync all your Logitech devices together.If you are hesitant this is a great mouse. I didn't go wireless as it was 4x the price, but either way, the G502 is something I may buy again for my laptop and recording PC soon. 10/10","August 12, 2021",5
Alfie,Perfect!,"I bought an mx3s and this at the same time so I could compare between the two.This mouse was it for me. The mx 3s was so much more expensive but this had a ton more functionality and a lot lighter to move. Idk why but I had wrist pains with the mx3s even though it was ergonomic. Granted, I wouldn't use this for heavy fps games because the battery inside makes it a bit heavy but its a great mouse for a work-game balance. I also have big hands and this suited my palms perfectly.","July 7, 2022",5
AM,Love this mouse,"My G9 finally bit the dust. Yes, it really was 15 years old. I was looking for a new mouse, and found this on sale. The weights feature is a must for me, and I've been able to adjust it perfectly. The mouse feels great!I'm a Linux user and was able to configure all mouse keys with Piper for Linux. It detected the GHero without issue and I was able to change RGB settings as well as keys. No logitech software required!My only issue is I have big paws, so the ""aim"" button that sits at the end of my thumb took a little bit to get use to. Unsure if me or if could have been positioned better. Still, I've been able to configure mouse buttons for all my games and actually using profiles which I've never done on my old mouse.A+","April 19, 2022",5
DYLANIDFWU,Amazing but........,"For starters , you need to download from the logitech website, then u can customize your buttons a simple yt search will show u how to remap(etc) alittle uncomfortable for me at least as i hold a mouse with my hand on a angle.Customization is really good set colour to profile for what game your playing (some games dont register so locking the profile is your best betAll in all for the price its an amazing deal, although i find it also a tad bit heavy and get fatigue fast ( new to mnk ) so that might be the cause","February 24, 2022",4
PS,"Lots of buttons, high palm posture, fast response","My G402 finally died and I decided to buy this mouse.There's tons of buttons - super customizable.Software is good but it's UX/UI is obnoxious - who puts video trailers for their products into software???? I mean really Logitech, stop it.Scrolling wheel is nice - it lets you scroll pages really fast.The really bad part about this mouse is ergonomics - the way you palm this mouse is really high up.So you end up sliding your hand all the way back or all the way forward to reach the side buttons. Logitech should have made this mouse longer by 2-3 cm and that would solve the problem.Price is meh when not on sale. But at $100+ I would skip this one.Connectivity is great - super responsive even on Bluetooth.","November 20, 2021",4
Christian,Great purchase,"Great mouse, I play MMOs, and so the additional buttons are extremely practical ! Love that there's an on/off switch at the bottom instead of an ""auto-off"" feature. I also use in on 2 PCs (desktop and laptop), so the switch button to BT/dongle is what I needed, this is the perfect mouse for my use.Pros ;- multiple buttons on the thumb rest area- switching to BT/dongle feature- use one AA battery (paired with rechargeable AA this is great IMO ; switch battery when dead, so no need to plug the mouse to charge it)- roaming settings (you can save your DPI setting in the mouse and it'll follow you, great for me when switching PCs)- infinite scroll wheel (that has weight to it)- precise sensor- LG software lets you make macros on the mouse buttonsCons ;- is large, so might not be comfortable for some people- no ""on"" LED status (I'm ok with it, but some prefer to have some indication when it's on or not)- use one AA battery (I know I put this in the pros, but if you don't have rechargeable AA, then you'll have to buy AA batteries, but it doesn't need to be changed often)","August 26, 2021",5
Cal,Nice mouse but very short lived.,"Update after 2 weeks of use:Did I mention that the Logitech utility goes and update itself automatically even though I specifically turned that function off?  So all of a sudden, my downgraded working version got updated to the buggy non-functional version all of a sudden.  This alone is worth 0-star.Update after 1 day of use:Very disappointed. Great mouse to use out of the box, but when i started programming the keys I noticed that scrolling down wouldn’t work even it was set by default originally.  Scrolling up still worked fine.  The GHub software is bad, hard to use and painfully unnecessary when setting things up.  The moment I try to use onboard profile, scrolling down stopped working.  If I restore default onboard profile, it worked.  Problem seems to be the moment anything changes to the onboard profile, it stops working. Still waiting for Logitech tech to see if it’s firmware issue or hardware issue.  But id hold off on getting this mouse because when I dig around online, G604 scrolling issue seems to be a known problem for months if not year.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but how could it works fine until programming?  Used 2 different computers with and without GHub, same thing.  Logitech is really failing their long time fans…..  I’ve used only Logitech mouse since high school. :( stop focusing on cloud and data mining and start focusing on user and usability. Any software after SetPoint is bad….  Options and GHub is way worse!!Original Thought:Finally a better mouse with long battery life.  Very solid to the feel and low-profile look.  I don't need no RGB nor led flashes, just long battery life when used as an office mouse.  (I had a G700s and man, changing battery or charging every 5-7 days is a real pain).  This one claims to be 5+ month when used in bluetooth mode, which I think is great.  When you game, switch over to Lightspeed and the reporting rate goes up to 1000 times, which is noticeable and smooth.As for the G-Hub software from Logitech, they are never good with programming since SetPoint.  The Logitech Option and G-Hub is downright bad and annoying.  Trying to program buttons and you'd wish you use a different brand altogether.","April 16, 2022",1

B,Perfect number of buttons and customizability,"I use this with a Chromebook all day at work. Though the Logitech software isn't compatible with ChromeOS, I was able to plug the mouse in at home on a Windows computer with the Logitech software, set everything I wanted like remapping buttons and choosing colors, and save it to the mouse so everything works as desired at work. I think it has just the right number of buttons for normal productive work.","July 9, 2022",5
mac,Customizable mouse with elite level control and some nice RGB styling,"This mouse has everything you need for many styles of gaming. I found the customizable weights a really nice touch, currently using all of them for the weightiest, sturdy feel. The RGG is fairly basic but easy to setup and sync with your other peripherals. There are 2 customizable buttons and 5 with preset functions, but those functions (DPI controls) are so useful I wouldn't recommend changing them anyways! I just discovered the sniper control (Hold for reduced DPI and more control) which is a really nice little bonus...The only thing that was unexpected is the scroll wheel which is free spinning and doesn't have any clicking points like you might be used to with other mice. This is a bit weird at first - great for quickly scrolling web pages but maybe not as good for building games where you may be rotating pieces into different positions (IE: Valheim base building). I got used to it eventually though!This is an awesome mouse and I highly recommend it.P.S. It's not that ergonomic, it's puts your hand at I'd say a 20 degree angle so if you're really looking for an ergo gaming mouse I'd look elsewhere. This is a comfy mouse regardless but if you're getting something for work or really long gaming sessions try something with a 45 degree or vertical orientation.","May 15, 2021",5
Ramz,Very comfortable and sturdy mouse,"This mouse is great overall, I originally got it for gaming and it feels just right, very comfortable, fits just like a glove.

Lior Terentiev,Probably the best mouse for the price,"I found that the G4 side button (lower right) doesn't work on my model, but that might just be because I'm trying to use the mouse with a linux pc.

Secret Man,Excellent mouse,"I've used Logitech mice and keyboards for pretty much forever, and every now and then I decide to dabble in another brand, and am always disappointed. They either have a cheap feel, the button presses don't feel quite right, have poor battery, aren't responsive, have connection issues, etc ... so then I go back to my old trusty Logitech and this doesn't disappoint.The 6 buttons on the side work perfectly and are easily programmable from the G HUB software.The DPI adjustments are seamless.The scroll wheel is amazing, it has 2 modes, hyper-fast (near infinite continuous scrolling) & normal mode, changing on the fly with a single button press.Can't speak to battery life myself as I've only had it about 2 months but the mouse runs on a single AA battery and so far no issues.The top face & side buttons are easy to use, have nice haptic feel and are responsive. No lag on the presses or the pointer movement.","December 5, 2021",5

Taflek,This mouse lasted only 1 year.,"I have to give this mouse a low rating for one reason only, it only lasted a year before the left mouse button switch failed.  When I disassembled the mouse to replace the switch, it was so overly complicated that I decided that it wasn't worth the time to re-assemble  the mouse. The last three mice I bout were all Logitech, the first one was bought in 2016 and lasted until 2019 just after the three year mark (Logitech G502 Proteus), the second a Logitech G602 Wireless Gaming Mouse, it lasted about a year and a half, my current and now I've decided last Logitech mouse I will ever buy is a Logitech G604 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse, that one lasted three weeks short of a year. It's not worth the price point anymore. Although all of those mice were good to my gaming addiction just to be clear. The battery lasted along time, just one AA battery, and the quality of the sensor is outstanding. The Logitech app is easy to use and very intuitive, and my Logitech keyboards never disappoint.  But no more mice, they just don't last.","July 28, 2022",2
Amazon Customer,Battery life is absolutely insane,"I bought this mouse a little less than two months ago and was gonna make a review once the battery that came included died. The battery included has not died yet and I am 100% sure that I can continue using the same battery for another month or more.I want to note that I came from the hyperion g402 and after 5 or so years, I wanted to upgrade to a wireless mouse with a similar shape. Between the wireless g502 and the g604, I chose this because its much cheaper and has more buttons.The GHub software works well and switches between games without any issues. The hyperscroll wheel is the greatest thing ever when you need to scroll through long pages. The left and right mouse buttons feel nice and clicky and aren't obnoxiously loud. I don't use the side scroll wheel buttons since it takes more effort than I'd like to press them but they are there. The 6 side buttons are absolutely great and I use them for whatever I feel like. In the desktop profile, I have some buttons as copy and paste.People label it as an MMO mouse but I use it to play FPS games and it works fine.","March 23, 2021",5
Alex,"Best mouse I've had in a while, but not durable","This mouse is awesome, but like most other mice I've had in recent years, the buttons wear fast and end up double-clicking and/or not being able to hold. This is a common issue I've had with different brands in the past few years, including Razer and Corsair. I'm both working and gaming with my mice, they get a lot of use. I used to be a Razr-only guy but their quality went down a lot in recent years so I'm trying new stuff. This is my second of this model, first one didn't last 6 months, left-click started messing around, double clicking on single clicks and being unable to hold a click (to drag stuff for example). The tracking quality however is unparalleled, it fits the hand perfectly, weight is really good, boutons are well placed, etc. Hopefully my first one that died early was a fluke, always had good experience with Logitech in the past.","May 10, 2021",4
KB,"great mouse, but very heavy","First the Bad:The mouse is very heavy, and worse it is back heavy. Clicking some buttons might lead you to slight lift the mouse accidentally in clutch situations. Not good for FPS. Only 1 onboard profile. The mouse has no button to switch profiles - it all happens on the software side. So only works if you are on Windows. Else you are stuck with 1 profile on linux.Now the Good:However, if you can get past that, the mouse is very customizable - great for mobo games and productivity.I like the fact that this mouse has the option of connecting via bluetooth or 2.4 Ghz with the usb dongle.In the end I returned it because of the weight.

Derek C,Great mouse with one big flaw (onboard memory),"Researched this mouse on Logitech's own website and the feature list is misleading.  The mouse ""does"" feature onboard memory to store commands without requiring their software on the computer to use the programmable buttons (the software is still required to program/customize the buttons initially), however only simple commands can be stored.  The onboard memory can't be used to store macros, which was the main feature I was looking for when shopping for a new mouse.  This limitation was omitted from the specs/information provided by Logitech, and only vague references of this inability can be found online.Maybe this is a niche feature / use-case, but I know I'm not the only one who uses it, and it's a huge thing to be able to offer.  In fact, my other Logitech mouse has this ability, so I have no idea why they would take it away from this mouse, which is way more expensive than my other one that has it.  Aside from that I really do like the mouse, it just can't do the thing I bought it for, and it's too much of a hassle to return.  Congrats, you got my money.","June 25, 2022",2
John-William,Give it some time!,"If you are not used to this sort of mouse layout, just give it some time.

Daniel D.,Still a great mouse,"You may have seen other reviews. It's a heavy mouse than most, its quite years old by design. But its still a great mouse, a gaming mouse standard. This is like the Toyota of gaming mice. Mine came in good condition and still working great. No weird clicking issues, noises, or scrolling issues. RGB is nice and the option of freely spinning the scroll wheel in a click of a button. The only downside I will say about this mouse is that its Logitech GHUB software, that its meant to work with, kinda sucks. The software its not needed if you just want a working G502 mouse. GHUB has a reputation to be pretty bad, in my experience, trying to make updates on the mouse is really difficult. I'm not an expert at mapping buttons on gaming peripherals but using GHUB to do so was confusing. Set aside the software, the mouse is excellent. I can see why this mouse is still popular.","July 28, 2021",5
D. Marois,So disappointed,"This is a great mouse. Unfortunately, Logitech's GHub software simply refused to recognize it most of the time. I'd get it working and an hour later it was brain-dead again. It could be this computer. I didn't try it on another machine. Maybe I should before sending it back. If GHub works on your system, it's hard to get a better value gaming mouse right now. Recommended with reservations.","November 19, 2021",4

Honestly, the high DPI settings are worthless, if they could release this with a 4000 dpi top polling rate, I’d like it just as much, tried 20000, and a light flick of the wrist moved the mouse pointer across 3 monitors in a millisecond, which doesn’t seem like it’s likely to be useful.","March 27, 2022",5

Guillaume Legault,Best Logitech mouse since the G9,"I loved the G9/G9x from Logitech. When my G9x broke down, I was looking for a replacement and was recommeded the G502 by a friend. I was sceptical because I use fingertip grip and he uses palm grip. Well, this mouse has been almost perfect for me. The only issue I had with it is my pinky finger had not adequate support. To fix the discomfort, I added a small peice of neoprene tape where my pinky is ""sitting"" on the mouse. Now the mouse ergonomy is PERFECT!The scroll wheel is awesome, the buttons are all well positioned and the sensor has really good tracking. I am using 3200 DPI with 1000Hz poll rate in Windows and it's butter smooth. The mouse is a bit on the heavy side BUT the glide feet do amazing job so the weight is not felt that much. The G-hub software is good but I really wished I could set independant DPI on both X/Y axises as I used to do with my G9.

L,Great mouse with one terrible flaw,"I'd like to start off by saying I love Logitech and I have been supporting them for years. I bought this mouse a year ago as an upgrade from my G602, which I'd used for years before the censor started giving out. I bought this mouse thinking it seems like a decent upgrade, and while it was for the year I had it, I cannot comfortably recommend any Logitech G mice because of the consistent issue they have with their switches. This is definitely one of my favourite sculpts ever and I love the way the buttons feel. A lot of people complain about the weight but for someone who loves a heavier mouse, this is super comfortable for me. However, I am once again emphasizing that you are rolling the dice when you purchase this mouse or any other Logitech G mouse-- your switches might last you a week, a month, a year... You never know. This is a fantastic mouse but the switches are not meant to operate on low voltage, which causes them to prematurely malfunction. I am urging you to not support Logitech G until they fix this switch issue.","March 24, 2021",3

I was told that Logitech's aftersales service was really good so I contacted support via live chat and they gave me the most trustful service I ever had, few questions asked, they didn't made me feel like I had to convince them. They sent me another one free of charge that I still use  on this day.  I finally bought this one for the wife's pc too for like 60 bucks.I've totally destroyed Razer mouses that were costing more than this mouse does, just like I destroy my enemies in Overwatch.

The app is also not bad, you can do a lot on it, with binds/macros.My only problem is, when you're fast swiping (in a game) the mouse, due to the way it is shaped you may inevitably hit a side button.","January 1, 2021",4

Slim Jim,Messed up a good thing,"When G602s started to go out of stock we bought 10, they are now distributed on the desks of our drafters with matching ones on my desk and at home. When the 604 came out it was overpriced, but recently went on sale so I bought 4 more. What a disappointment. Compared to the 602 they have managed to screw up the scroll wheel so bad it is barely useable.Side buttons are identical, perfect for CAD or gaming, ergo is good. Can't comment on battery life.Scroll Wheel - Wow - so many issues. Firstly, a gimmicky freewheel that sounds like it's going to break every time you press the button, which will be about 3 times until the novelty wears off.The smooth stainless scroll wheel, for that cool free-wheeling action, has increased scrolling detents 5X - with the smooth scroll wheel texture and increased detent the wheel is extremely difficult to scroll, sometimes triggering middle-click or side scroll events, which is a surprise because...The middle click resistance also increased by 5x, triggering scroll and or side click events.Also, there is no preference in the mechanism for middle-click, as the side scroll click resistance is easily 1/3 of the middle click resistance. The result is that you will not be able to assign anything useful to your two new buttons.If you have never used a 602 I understand that this mouse may seem great, but you don't know what you are missing.The all-black is super nice looking, and a bit lighter with the one battery, again all the rage these days, but at 3000DPI I only use a 1"" box to work my screen.If this mouse wheel had been the same as the 602, with added side scroll, well-tuned, it would be 6 stars. As is it is barely useable for my workflow. I may dismantle it and fix it.","November 23, 2020",2
Kamal,Slippery scroll wheel,Very smooth and responsive mouse. This mouse replaced G402 that I have been using for few years. It is very similar to G402 except that it has higher DPI and has infinite scroll wheel option which I really liked. The thing that I did like on this mouse is that the scroll wheel on this mouse is hard and Slippery. It may loosen up over time. The scroll wheel is metal and has a weird kind of coating on it. Rubberized coating would have been better imo.,"August 21, 2021",4
Amazon Customer,"Great mouse, NO ISSUES","Honestly I have no appreciation for the negative reviews of this mouse.  All the 'tHe LeFt MoUsE BuTtOn iS BrOkEn' is likely due to angry heavy handed gamers bashing the ever living you know what out of it when playing FPS's, seemingly not realizing that mice don't work any better when the buttons are bashed like a hammer hitting a nail.For me, I am using a gentle touch and I can confirm that this mouse is fantastic.

Amazon Customer,Great for both games and productivity,"Responsive, practical, nice weight if that's what you like, and feels reasonably well made. The buttons on the side take some getting used to but they're handy once you figure it out. Having both Bluetooth and the wireless dongle is handy for quickly switching between computers, like if you have a laptop and a desktop next to each other. I love the infinite scroll wheel, though I don't like the plastic around it; at the base of the wheel, you have kind of an awkward edge. Rounding that edge would have elevated the ergonomics of the mouse.  Besides that, the only other downside of this mouse I can think of is that the rubber gets dirty pretty fast, especially in the little divots.Battery life seems pretty good, lasting about 4 months of daily use with the included wireless USB dongle.","June 18, 2021",5
Phil M'cup,Solid,My go to mouse. I used my previous one for around 3 years before having any issues. It actually still works and I handed it down to a family member. The new one definitely feels more accurate. Feels great to have a new one.This mouse is one of the only ones I've tried that hasnt caused me any wrist pain. Great for people with bigger hands. The thumb rest is a must. If you find it a bit heavy just play with the weights in for a few weeks then remove them. It'll be like you're goku training in high gravity.,"November 17, 2021",5
MilkMan,Good,"Moving to wireless from the MX518, this is finally the one with the ergonomics to match and non-irritating battery life.  On the downside, the range isn't the greatest with the lightspeed dongle, but it works flawlessly within close range.  Bluetooth is only good for occasional use as it goes to sleep often and there's a wake up delay, and all the programmable functions don't work over Bluetooth.  This would be a 5 star if the G keys were supported over Bluetooth.","July 21, 2021",4
RyanCA,Great for all my uses,I am a palm/claw hybrid gamer and this works just fine. Buttons respond quickly. Everyone is different in terms of hand size and grips but personally I would have liked the mouse to be a *little* bit wider...but definitely not a deal breaker.,"June 10, 2022",5

I've noticed overall this is the case with the newer ones-Love the ergonomic design, i've worn out the rubber on at least 3 of these, the new one seems to be made of better rubber-Great customizable weight-The heavy long scroll mousewheel feature is very useful for spamming a key (for bhopping for example)-Additional buttons make gaming and shortcuts easier if you set them up right-I dont use many profiles but you can quickly switch them out-Excellent customer support","May 7, 2021",5
BrandonH,"Great upgrade from g502 Proteus, but with a huge cost for gaming","Love everything about the G502 series and prior to getting the Hero, I was using the older G502 Proteus Core with no issue. The old mouse still works perfectly fine, however I wanted something new, but kind of the same; sounds strange but that's just me I guess.I don't care much for the RGB lighting and DPI switches, but the mouse feels fantastic ergonomically. I can go half a day of playing games with my friends without having any pain in my hands while they have to quit because of their general hand/wrist pains. It's pretty much identical to the older g502s, except the sensor feels quite a bit smoother (at least on a 144hz display) and it just feels so good for everyday use.The G502 series is pretty great for gaming. I never used the G-Shift for FPS games as my small hands can't really reach it with my thumb without an awkward grip change. But for some reason the new G502 Hero has a glaring issue where the sensor goes haywire and your cursor goes into the corner of your screen and you can't move the cursor and you would be spinning in place, frantically. The way to fix it is to lift your mouse up and reset the sensor, until it randomly happens again. It's quite annoying when you're doing your normal day-to-day browsing. However it is absolutely vexing when you are playing an FPS and suddenly your crosshair flips around and you start spinning around. Looked for solutions online and some other users definitely have similar issues, but there doesn't seem to be a solution yet. Probably just a DoA but on a  ~$80 mouse it's kind of ridiculous. Definitely not something you'd want for competitive gaming.","January 5, 2020",2

Steven Li,Feels Great So Far - One LED burned out on Day 1,"The mouse feels great so far. I have not run into the issues mentioned in some of the reviews yet (accidentally clicking the additional buttons, double-clicking randomly etc). I really love how the scroll wheel can be toggled between a notched a free-rolling scroll.However, one LED has already burned out since I received the product. Not a big issue, certainly not one worth RMA-ing for. Hopefully, the mouse will continue to work well.","June 29, 2021",4
Angie,So far so good,"I was kind of skeptical getting this mouse because of software issues and double clicking I've had with my previous logitech mouse. I had a wireless G703 which was about double the price I paid for this one and it had double clicking issues which was really annoying. It would stop shooting even though you're still holding the left click. Gaming became really un enjoyable because of those issues. I thought I would just try my luck again with this mouse and so far, so good. It has a dpi shift button on it which I guess is good if you're using a sniper in an fps. There's 2 dpi buttons, one to increase and one to decrease dpi. The scrolling wheel I find is a little odd. The setting where it stops the wheel in positions doesn't fully stop the wheel. If you just skid your finger up, the wheel won't come to an instant stop. It also comes with weights.","January 5, 2021",5
Dwight,Upgrade from the G602 in every way,"The g604 is an upgrade from the g602 in every way. My g602 stopped working and seems to have been discontinued by logitech, so I figured it was time to upgrade. This new mouse, the g604, fits much more comfortably in my hand, is much more light-weight, and has a nice matte finish on the plastic parts. The sides and middle segment of the mouse are rubberized and have a nice texture, and the middle mouse button is probably my favorite feature for this entire mouse- the infinite scrolling is super fun to play with, and the scroll wheel is cool to the touch which feels nice against hot hands.Im glad I upgraded! For those wondering, you do not need to unplug your old receiver extension cable (for logitech wireless mice) from your PC to use this mouse- you just need to swap the little usb receiver that comes inside the mouse with the old one and it works just as well","November 12, 2020",5

There are several buttons and the mouse is supported by the Logitech G HUB application on computer where you can set up macros and adjust colors, brightness, settings for different games, etc. One problem I found was it was uncomfortable for me when first using the mouse because I have large hands and the mouse is a bit small but over time I have adjusted to it and feel no problems.","October 18, 2020",4
Aleks,Greatest mouse,"The best mouse I have ever used. Although I am writing the review of the Hero version of the G502, I have had the Proteus Core for close to 5 years and have not had a single fault with it. All the buttons are still solid as if the mouse had come out of the box yesterday. There is no looseness to the clicking or any type of wobbling. I know because I literally put the Hero and the Proteus Core side by side and started clicking away to see if the Proteus Core had worn out in any way throughout its years of use. Didn’t find anything. I bought the Hero because I wanted the same mouse I have had for years on both of my computers and because it was on a promotion. No other reason than that. I’m sure there are people that would disagree with me but this mouse is ridiculously comfortable on top of looking sharp.Previously I had a Razer Mamba 2012Edition and although at the time it was a good mouse, the G502 is more comfortable. I would highly recommend it to anyone","May 7, 2019",5

CanuckGirl,Great battery life on bluetooth mode,"I use this mouse for work, as I need a lot of macros and having the ability for various keyboard shortcuts on the mouse is vital on a day-to-day basis. I use the bluetooth mode to extend the battery life, so far, after a few weeks, the battery is still going strong. Mouse software seems to work find, tough I can't seem to make the double-click button work in the Mac OS (it works in everything else). Comfortable to hold all day, and I love the Logitech hyper scroll wheel (I don't know why they don't make every mouse like that.) It's a good step up from the older G700s that I had, which which had a rechargeable battery that barely lasted the day. I like that there are more buttons on the side, though a couple of them are a little farther forward than is comfortable to use frequently, so I've programmed those as less-used shortcuts. In short, it's a great wireless mouse for daily use at work.","January 24, 2020",5
Celine,Love the mouse wheel,"I bought this as a recommendation from my husband, and I ended up really liking it. I've owned several different gaming mice, and for the most part haven't really paid attention to the quality of them, but I have to admit that I like this one a lot.The clicking feels tactile, and the buttons are conveniently placed. I have rather small hands, but I feel like I can still access all the buttons and comfortably hold the mouse. The scroll wheel can be locked to have a more controlled scroll, or unlocked and free to infinitely scroll-- and this really appeals to some primal monkey instinct inside the brain whenever you give it a good spin.It also comes with weights that you can put into the bottom of the mouse, which I've never used before, but have come to appreciate. Between the several DPI profiles you're able to set up, the weights, and the scroll-lock, the control provided is great for gaming, especially if you need something to keep up with fast paced, precise gameplay.","September 11, 2019",5
Dad,Best mouse you can buy for gaming! Have 2 of them.,"Oddly enough when I first think of what qualities I want in a mouse, lightweight and durable is a must.The first mouse I bought I never ended up using the included weights that come with it.On to my second one (first still fully working after 3 years, but replaced my whole setup) and the past week I'm finding the addition of 3 of the weight (comes with 5) has made the mouse feel ever better.The size is great as I would save I have average size hands.The weight makes for excellent tracking as a use a full desk size gaming pad.I used to use a bungee to keep the cord from moving but opted out and its making no difference at this point.

We play games too! :)- I found the top to be a bit too slippery, and so purchased some of the Razer grips (needed to reshape them a bit, but otherwise worked fine).- nice big side buttons all around.- easy to make and switch profiles for different uses.

Aysha Rather,"Lasted 10 months, right button stopped working","It lasted 10 months before the right mouse button stopped responding. Now it double clicks, or just doesn’t respond and I know it’s the mouse because I’ve plugged in and tried different ones when it started behaving this way. Which makes me sad, it’s so pricey (I got it for $69.99 almost a year ago, so the original $99 doesn’t stay. Don’t rush yourself buying this) but it lasted way too short. Which really doesn’t fit to the 50 million clicks narrative. There are the positive that it fits in my hand well, but some trigger/buttons don’t make sense because I have to make my way to press those buttons, they’re very awkward to reach. It doesn’t tire my hand though. Which I love, but it does feel little chunky. Could be smaller, again maybe why I can’t press the buttons. I love the app that comes with it for customizing lights/dpi settings. You can create your own profiles. The scroll button for me worked well, though I really haven’t found where I would use it????","June 3, 2020",3
philippe,Low durability if for extensive/long term use,"First of all, the design on an ergonomic point of view is pretty much well done. I had a G500 before (and still at work) for work and this mouse was top notch. The 502 is still impressive for the features and buttons are very well disposed.However, I m not that happy with the product since I have used it for approx 10 months and it already has difficulties to hold clic (for drag and drop). I use the mouse mostly for work and gaming. Its the 2nd logitech mouse that I go trough in less than 2 years (g302 also wich double clicked all the time after couple of months).So It might be the last logitech G I buy.Regards","March 16, 2021",3

Stuart,*was* Best wired mouse...until the double clicking.,"UPDATED REVIEW (1 YEAR)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Yep, the mouse started double clicking. A lot. All the time. By itself. Renders it unusable for most games. I've kept this mouse in pristine condition with no throwing drops etc.So I contacted support...looks like it's a common issue and a bad batch of hardware went to a bunch of mice. Alright. They sent me a new mouse free of charge (identical) and let me keep the old one. Seemed great but it's also started double clicking, it's especially noticeable when dragging a window around.You'll get about 6 months of daily use from these mice before parts start to deteriorate...will be looking for another brand. 3/5, only for their great customer support.OLD REVIEW BELOW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Great for large hands palm grip. The button placement is great.Honesty best mouse I've ever laid my hands on.The weights I added made it super nice to skid around the hardpad with.RMB and LMB are the right sensitivity, scrollwheel is the right feeling.If you're coming from a defective razer mamba tournament edition, yes, buy this mouse. 5/5","September 25, 2019",3

I haven't been able to replace the skates and eliminate the scratching issue.

KVO,"Love the feel of the mouse, hate the double-clicking problem (PROBLEM SOLVED FOR ME)","It was a great mouse for a few months until this problem of double-clicking appeared. It is detrimental for both gaming & certain tasks. Two examples:1. ADS'ing with this problem is frustrating because it puts you back into hip firing immediately.2. Dragging around something is another thing because whatever you're trying to hold gets dropped. Which is annoying.I really like this mouse's overall structure, but sadly I might have to switch to another mouse my friend is using that doesn't have the double-clicking problem.(UPDATE) Was playing around with the Logitech software, discovered that my mouse's report rate was too high (1000/s). Reduced it all the way down to 125/s and no more double-clicking","February 24, 2021",5

Lenn Dolling,Designed to give to your enemy that you play games against.,"If you want a mouse that will misbehave while you are using it then this is for you.Design flaw:  3 buttons near your Left Mouse Button that are designed to change the speed of your mouse while you are using it!!!  What?  Are you kidding me.  Once the trigger is accidentally triggered during game-play you will NEVER get it back to where you were.  ""Game-over you lose""Design flaw:  escape/back near your thumb where you grip the mouse, so when you reach for your mouse you may accidentally hit escape / undo what you just did.  Lamest thing I have experienced over the years with all the fancy mice that one might buy.  Who really needs a escape button on the mouse?  Lamers.Ohh, you will also need software to run with the mouse which will bog down your system and which will  grant you a little pop up on screen telling you what mouse speed you are running and course when you hit it during game-play nothing will show, so you are lost hitting buttons trying to get back to the speed you were at.  This mouse is not designed for gaming where you want to win.Like I said if you want to win, then give this mouse to the person that you are playing against.","April 20, 2022",1

Sasa A.,My favourite mouse period,The ergonomics of this mouse is amazing. It feels great in the hand with various well positioned buttons that can be programmed to do different things in game. I feel that the weights are unnecessary for me but for the the people that can use them there easy to put in and don’t come out easily. This mouse is freaking solid for gaming it glides well and has a great and accurate sensor. The only criticism I could give it is it’s weight. It’s a fairly heavy mouse coming in at 121 grams. Overall this is a sleek looking mouse that is well built and high quality the switches feel good and it feels great in the hands. Would recommend to anyone that likes to play games or just likes a comfortable mouse.,"November 29, 2020",5

Mike,Accuracy and smoothness,"This mouse works well for what I need out of a gaming mouse. Resolution is fine and it tracks well on my mouse pad. The only issue that I have had, updating the firmware. Using the Logitech G Hub, it determined that an update was available. I followed the onscreen directions and nothing happened, it just seem to hang up. After doing some research and reading, a suggestion I saw was to enable on-board memory mode.  It worked.","December 8, 2020",4

Ch^2,Great mouse ruined by widespread defect,"I've been using this mouse for a bit over a year now and it was a great mouse while it worked. The logitech software is fine and perfectly capable of remapping the buttons and changing the dpi. the weights that allow you to change the weight of the mouse are neat but I never used them and they seemed more akin to a gimmick, the mouse is already sufficiently heavy as is and I didn't need to make it any heavier. The scroll wheel felt great, you can feel each individual ""scroll"". The button to toggle the free scrolling wheel is quite enjoyable I did use it on equation so it's slightly better than a gimmick.The great disappointment for me is that it recently begun having problems with the left click. Once it begins it is incredibly annoying and gets in the way of whatever you're doing. I've had a cheap little wireless mouse for over twice as long and I haven't experienced a problem with it like I have the g502.I'd recommend to look for other mouse options because although it didn't break straight away, the fact that there is such a widespread problem with it that appears not too later in its life, you're better off spending $80 dollars on a mouse that'll last.","April 28, 2021",2
Omar Tayyem,Great mouse! Minor issues making it not for me.,"I actually also purchased this after my mamba TE's crappy laser sensor started having horrible tracking issues, However I had a problem where my g502 mouse scroll wheel rattled but the major downside was how the mouse fit. I have really large hands and the spacing between the buttons and the thumb rest was way to small and made it uncomfortable to use. However I got a full refund by Logitech so it's fine.In conclusion if you have really big hands like me stay clear of this mouse. I just am really disappointing about the mouse wheel rattling because it's apparently a common issue and Logitech if your hearing please fix this.Logitech's customers service was good however and *Through amazon"" I got a full refund in a matter of days.So good product just not for me.","March 18, 2019",4

The hyper scroll feature could be handy in games that require rapid clicking but I personally dont need it.,"May 3, 2021",5

The dual connection is awesome I have the USB fob connected to my gaming PC and bluetooth to my work laptop, it takes half a second to stitch. Battery is awesome and don't see changing this for another few months.Cons: The software sucks I still don't know how the different profiles switch in the mouse.

Amazon Customer,"Not actually comfortable, not good for gaming","The main reason I wanted this mouse was to clear up the wires on my desk but still be able to game. This mouse is not only clunky and cumbersome for fast movements, but worst of all, it loses its position if you move fast and even experiences lag at crucial moments. It's good enough for casually using your desktop, but it's not a gaming mouse. I also don't appreciate the constantly running application in the background, and how easy it is to accidentally change sensitivities.","May 17, 2022",2

On future models, I hope they move the keys a bit further forward.","August 21, 2020",5

Sparksxx,Interesting mouse,"I've used Razer Naga & Deathader and the reason i changed from naga to deathader was because my naga was malfunctioning. After using my deathader for about 3 years i realised i needed more buttons hence i was searching for a mouse again. Not too much buttons like Naga but not too little buttons like deathadder. I found G502, you can reprogram the buttons that you think you might not use to what they allow in the logitech program. I have a fairly small hand i would say and it's perfect for me. I can make it heavier or lighter which is the fun part.Pros:-Good Wiring-comfortable-not too many buttons and not too little buttonsCons:-my Razer mice had gold plating on the USB not sure why Logitech isnt using gold plating not that i know if its affecting the mouse in any way that i know of.","August 12, 2019",5
Andrew Hill,"Too much DPI, poor button placement","I tried really hard to like this mouse. I love my Logitech Artemis headset, so when the scroll wheel on my Razer mouse broke I decided to switch to a Logitech mouse so they could run on the same driver software. This was the nicest Logitech mouse I could find with enough buttons to satisfy my gaming needs, so I picked it up. I will say it has a lovely scroll wheel, that's about the only thing I like about it.The most glaring issue is the massive button directly where your thumb rests which toggles the DPI of the mouse. You constantly hit this button by accident, messing with your DPI settings, so I immediately turned it off. Can't even repurpose it for a different function, because it just gets clicked constantly by accident.I was also extremely underwhelmed by the software, which has much weaker macro capabilities compared to Razer's. No way to set up rapid-fire, no auto-profile switching from exe detection, no integration between other Logitech products, just very basic. The only in-depth feature is DPI, which has 3 buttons on the mouse devoted to it and a decent setup menu in the software. However, I couldn't care less about DPI, and never want it to change from the value I set, so it doesn't really benefit me.I put up with it for two days, realized it wasn't going to get any better, and I'm now back to using my broken Razer until I can buy another one.","May 4, 2020",2
Franco Gagliano,Amazing mouse,"just bought this mouse, so happy with it, the only things i would change if i could is the button where my thumb sits. its very annoying because if i just hold my mouse too hard i accidentally push the button. The default setting for that button is used to change your DPI and that was horrible, i took that off right away. in the middle of a stressful round when i have to clutch up, if my mouse changes DPI that will surely lose me the game, other than that, GREAT mouse quality, would recommend!","June 30, 2020",4

Sean,Logitech's Quality Has Gone Down,"I had bought the Logitech G502 just yesterday, and noticed instantly that my aim and tracking was much better than my old G403 mouse (the new hero sensor feels much more accurate and connected with my hand). Everything about the mouse was amazing and I am very happy with the design, weight and quality of the product.Unfortunately after just one day of use, the mouse would stop tracking quite often when I would hold left click for some odd reason. I had noticed a slight rattle inside when I had taken the mouse out of the packaging, and could feel a component moving inside when I would change directions on my mousepad (my g403 previously started showing signs of a defective scroll wheel only after 3 months of use and now is almost unusable in which I have to click the side bar to scroll).I am and have been a Logitech Fanboy for the past 10 years, and although I barely write any reviews on the internet, I felt that this was a huge disappointment on my end that could not be ignored. After my G602, (which I had used for 7 years before I broke it myself by dropping) I have been quite disappointed with the longevity and reliability of the products. I have initiated a replacement order and will update my review if there is another or no issue with the new mouse. I hope that the new product will live up to the Logitech name.On a side note, Amazon's Customer Service exceeded expectations and I definitely will be buying more electronics from them in the future.","August 14, 2021",1

I'm an average guy, on the stronger side and this mouse is too slow for me.I taught I would like a heavy mouse.

They call it G Hub and it's where you will customize buttons, lighting, macros, profiles, everything. It's really, really bad.The hardware seems solid, buttons are well within reach of my smaller-than-average hands.

Maxime,"Good mouse, room for improvement","I have the Logitech MX Master 3 at work, and that scroll wheel is very superior to the one on the G502. The G502's one is a bit too noisy and hard to scroll compared to the MX Master 3's. The button to toggle between the scrolling modes is also not programmable on the G502.However, the precision and speed of the G502 is superior for gaming compared to the MX Master 3. Would recommend the wired version for gaming to avoid bad surprises when your Bluetooth connections cuts, or if you run out of battery at a bad timing.The GHub software also has some bugs and poor UX. It's very hard to assign a simple keyboard press to a button, you need to create a macro for each one. It also bugs out when you put your computer to sleep and stops recognizing your games.Edit:I had to lower to 2 stars from 4 because the Logitech GHUB software is terrible. After the update it won't recognize my mouse anymore, and buttons don't work well. The only option is to use the inboardmemory software, which doesn't switch profile and doesn't have as many options.

I found myself accidently hitting other buttons during frantic moments in several different games.  The thumb buttons are placed very low on the mouse. So many times while picking the mouse up to do flick shots. I found I would depress and activate those thumb buttons by accident.This mouse is good. I just can't recomend it for gaming.

Sarah ,A great mouse!,"I mostly bought this specific mouse because my boyfriend owns a earlier version (which is identical to this one), so I had been able to try it out and I liked how it fit my hand.

It comes with weights to adjust the mouse exactly how you want it, and it has a decent number of extra buttons to assign tasks to.

Saman Dayani,"Faulty out of the box, sticky left click and noisy","                    The media could not be loaded.                 Its a great mouse if it works... mine was faulty out of the box so ended up talking to the support and instead of sending a replacement and getting this one back they just refunded so i guess ill be looking for another one. One other thing i would mention is the scroll, unlimited scrolling is great but the default scroll just feels straight up weird nothing like ive ever experienced before. also when you shake the mouse it feels like the scroll is wiggling in there and makes a noise but apparently thats normal.","July 18, 2022",1
Troy,Fantastic Mouse,I've been using this mouse for over a year now and it's perfect.  Very accurate and reliable.  I've been a Logitech user for a very long time and have always been impressed with their products.  My last mouse was wireless but I do prefer the wired one as you don't have to worry about losing power.  Only issue I have is with the G HUB software.  It's not a good program and often crashes.  It's not easy to figure out all the settings (they are not intuitive at all!)  I'm an experienced computer guy and I do not like the G HUB software at all.,"April 2, 2020",5
Pax,g502's are still my favorite mouse,"This was the first gaming mouse model I've tried that felt right as soon as I put it in my hand.

(until you wear out the clicks, which you will eventually if u game like a degen like i do)","August 22, 2021",5
Nurse Mike,Great mouse,"Bought this mouse while it was on sale and haven't looked back. What I like most about it is the buttons - 6 on the side, two on the left mouse button, three on the top, and the left and right mouse buttons.

Jeison Souza,Very satisfied,"It's my very first ""gaming"" mice, and I'm very pleased with it.Very solid unit, came with weights so you can have it more or less light to meet your preferences.Very comprehensive software so you can configure the behavior of the differents sets of buttons and have some games profiles, very usefulI don't think it's too expensive, to be an Logitech unit.Very good product for my bucks.","May 23, 2021",5

Nix,A very cheap feeling mouse,"I bought this mouse as I was missing the infinite scroll feature from a G900 that my toddler took for a wash.  The infinite scroll feature works as expected but the whole product feels cheap and shoddily put together. the scroll wheel it's self feels loose, the battery knocks about when moving the mouse, the plastic housing feels flimsy. I've gone back to my deathadder pro (which was a similar price and is of immeasurably higher quality ) and will be returning this. Very disappointing from Logitech.","September 22, 2022",1

Colten Reviews,"Major flaw that will drive your crazy, eventually","Loved this mouse. It looks great, feels great and has more buttons than I'll ever need. Unfortunately the main button I use is the left click and it fails inevitably... At first I thought the settings were messed up and spent hours trying to trouble shoot and diagnose the issue. Countless mis clicks caused me serious grief time and time again. It went from being an extremely rare issue that I thought was my own doing, to the absolute norm. The mouse becomes essentially unusable when the left click spring fails. I have no idea how this product has such high ratings, as there is no shortage of bad reviews and videos online demonstrating the cheap engineering consequences outside of Amazons curated reviews.I will also note that I am not a hardcore gamer. I literally use this mouse for all my basic general PC needs. The games I do play once in awhile are Paradox games like Crusader Kings 3 and Europa Universalis which are the most basic of games that could not possibly be responsible for accelerated wear and tear.The bottom line is that there are much more reliable and durable mouse's out there. This feels like an Amazon exclusive cheap Chinese knock off strictly mass produced to make as much money as possible. I have gone through two of these in a year, so you may as well just spend double now on a top tier quality mouse. It's not worth the headaches it will cause you.","August 25, 2021",1
Amazon Customer,Seriously don't buy this mouse,I've been using logitech mouse for 10+ years so I thought this brand was a no brainer when it came to computer mouse.Well not at all.

Joshua Gibbons,Starting to lose faith in Logitech,"I ended up getting this mouse because my Proteus started having issues with the clicks sometimes unclicking despite me holding the mouse. That thing wasn't that old, but whatever. I've been a logitech supporter since I was a kid, so I got a hero replacement.It came with the same click issue essentially out of the box. Not as bad as my old mouse but it still happens.Thinking on it, I've been having issues with a lot of logitech products in recent years. Replacing keyboards is becoming a yearly to biyearly event, despite the high cost I pay for them. Not like my OG G15 that lasted over a decade. Mice I replace often. Even my logitech headsets.Starting to consider looking at other brands going forward.","December 8, 2019",3

It looks off and doesn't feel quite right when my finger hovers over it.","December 14, 2020",5
Katie,Better than most,"I liked this mouse right out of box. It looks cool, feels nice in the hand, and I like that I can change the weight. However after about a week or so its not working as it used to. The cursor is jerky, which is what was happening to my old cheap mouse this was replacing. I've done everything I can think of to fix this but the problem is still there. Granted I bought this mouse via warehouse deal. But the description said it was in good working condition. Hopefully others have more luck than I.","May 8, 2019",4

Brad L,Weird Weight Balance and Clicky Scroll Wheel,"I had high hopes for this mouse but found it really uncomfortable in my hand and it has a strange weight balance. It feels like all the weight is in the back right corner of the mouse (where the battery is) and it isn't well balanced. Also the scroll wheel isn't that smooth.  It ""clicks"" every time you scroll it.  If you spin the wheel it is actually loud.  It reminds me of the wheel from Price is Right.

Evan Wen,Some minor annoyance but good overall,"Uses a good design of the g502 lineup and it is great for general use cases if I had to be picky, i wouldn't buy this specifically for FPS games because of the heavier weight in comparison to other competition. There is also an issue of a slight but noticeable noise when shaking the mouse side to side you can hear the scrolling wheel bumping sounds that makes it sound really cheap and also the side scrolling function couldn't adjust scroll speed so it is stuck at a low side scroll speed for me and quite annoying.","March 2, 2019",4
Romeo,Defective on almost every level after a few months of gaming!,"The mouse is just not durable. The left click is atrocious. Let me write a list right now explaining how bad this mouse is. At first glimpse, this mouse was perfect. It performed well on every level and it did great. I bought this in May 2020 and now it is October 2020 and the left click is failing. And when I mean failing, I mean that it is double clicking, it cannot highlight without losing hold of the highlight and sometimes it just doesn't click at all. This mouse is not durable if you play a lot of heavy FPS or moba games where it requires you to be spamming the left click. Please don't buy this mouse because it's not honestly a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. I really  regret buying this mouse. GOOGLE logitech g502 hero mouse left click issues and you'll the number of people who have defective mouses because logitech has failed to not only fix this issue but also compensate those who have this issue and cannot do anything to fix ite and I don't ever plan on buying nor supporting logitech anymore because I am not the only who has this issue. As I am writing this, I still have trouble highlighting the words that I want to edit or delete, but I cannot because of this stupid damn mouse. If you buy this mouse, you'll just end up regretting it after 6 months of heavy use with it, because that's when the left click will start to have issues and you'll regret wasting $100+ on a damn mouse that fails you in half a year.","October 12, 2020",1

Heather,Known defect the company refuses to fix,"I just finished with my second G502 Hero, and my experience was so terrible that I don't intend to ever buy another Logitech mouse. As others have noted, there is a known defect with this mouse, where it will suddenly stop registering a single click as a single click, but interprets it as a double click, making it useless. It also stops being able to click-and-drag, so if you use it for, say, gaming or work, it's a never-ending frustration.My first time this happened, at just over a year old, Logitech wanted a video recording of the mouse in use, along with a long list of other requirements. Eventually, I got my replacement, but the replacement then did the exact same thing a year later. Upon contacting Logitech again, they wanted another video and handwritten note, but then decided it was beyond warranty. They do this in spite of being well aware of this known defect, and failing to fix it.Even a basic mouse should last more than a year, and a gaming mouse should not continue to be produced with a known defect that renders it useless with only moderate usage. Do not buy.","December 30, 2021",1

Valeri Yefimov,Doesn't seem to be very resilient,"Bought the mouse last year in august due to my older mouse finally dying on me after 5 years of extensive use. Decided to go for something i thought was more reliable and nice which was this logitech g502 hero. Well after a year and a half of use the left mouse button started to not react properly and will either double click or not click at all.Now you may say to yourself ""well a year and a half of extensive use can do that possibly so its not that bad"" and to that i say maybe. But what if i tell you that out of these 15 months i spent 7 away from home due to work. So in reality the mouse saw 8 months of fairly normal gaming and everyday use and the LMB stopped working properly.I loved the mouse the whole time i used it but for the price i would expect the longevity of the mouse to be a bit further as my older mouse was the cheaper and lasted almost 5 times as long.","November 20, 2020",2

Amazon Customer,Stopped working after less than 5 months,"I originally thought this mouse was amazing and it fit all my needs at the time. Didn't even have to think about it for like 4 months because when it works it works. Then about 5 months in a start to notice issues with the left click. Sometimes it double clicks for no reason, and other times it releases the left click when im trying to click-and-drag a window to a different monitor. Then i start noticing during pvp gaming sessions that while clicking-and-holding left click to fire a gun, it would release as if i wanted to stop shooting someone mid gunfight. I tried contacting Logitech support and my god is that sh!t abysmal. SO HARD to find which of the 12 phone numbers is the correct one, and they leave you on hold for HOURS and sometimes just hang up on you.As the weeks have gone by ive tried my own fixes like software updates and physically cleaning the mouse and really i thought it would feel better but then a day later go back to being garbage. I think its worse now about 2-3 months later as even the right click is letting me down. BTW YES i have been in contact with logitech support for the 3 months because they take fvkking WEEKS OR MORE to reply to emails. scam artists will do anything to avoid honoring their own warranty.all in all after this experience i still need to find a new mouse and will never buy another logitech product again.","November 6, 2020",1

Every time i clicked once, there was a chance that it would double click for some reason.

Dillon,"Good Mouse, Fits my hand nicely but Double click issues","Got this mouse in September for roughly 10 months of gaming, mouse started to have issues around 6-7 months i thought it was just me double clicking but looking online seems i was not the only one having issues with this.At first the double clicking wasnt bad but now I cant even aim, drag or click on anything without it double clicking.I'd recommend it for comfort and the size but if you get double clicking issues id return the mouse right away.","August 17, 2020",3

Patrick L.,Software for this is junk.,"This is my 3rd gen mouse of this style by Logitech, and I can say emphatically to buy another mouse.  The software that supports this is junk. 60% of the time I can't change my profile or DPI as the software stops responding to the mouse.  The software still works fine with other logitech devices (keyboard, headset).  The issue is specific to this mouse.","February 6, 2021",3
Eric ,Good mouse terrible company,"This mouse is a good mouse. But after a year I started getting double clicking on the rmb. I contacted logitech to get it replaced under warranty. After 4 phone calls over 30 emails 3 different customer service agents and month of waiting I still don't know if they are going to replace it. They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. After calling the first time and having their agent stay silent on the phone for over an hour I decided to try the online services and for some reason they sent my request to the eroupean region and had to transfer my ticket to the north america office. For some reason this meant I had to do a 3 round of trouble shooting making videos and proving I am not lying about my issue. After being told I would be contacted on 3 days I waited 2 weeks and decided to call to find out what happen when my ticket for transfered again. Now I am on day 27 and still don't know if my request for a replacement has been denied or accpect. The only answer I am getting is ""we are sorry if this has caused you any inconveniences but rest assured we are looking into it for you."" I really liked this mouse but unfortunately I can't back a company that treats their customers this way.","January 28, 2021",1
Andrew,Excellent Upgrade,"Been using a Logitech G700 for nearly a decade and it was solid. So when it began to give out I immediately went to see what Logitech had in its current lineup and this fit the bill. Good number of programmable buttons, easily replaceable battery, and very smooth, responsive feel. I use it more for productivity than gaming since I like to have numerous basic functions I use repeatedly programmed in and the G604 has been more than satisfactory.","November 10, 2020",5

Michael,Double click issue still occuring,"Overall the mouse is not a 1-star unit but the lack of a solution from LG is earning them such a low rating.

Andrew ,"Fantastic, if you have small hands","A really quality, well built, light mouse. The ONLY thing I had  problem with was that it was far too small for my hand. I had no where to put my pinky and couldn't grab it properly. Had to return it to get a wireless Razer Naga Epic Chromax off of Ebay because that actually fits my hand.","March 24, 2020",4
Quinn,Finally another worthy mouse,"I have used the G710s since it was released. For me it was the end all be all mouse with the highest comfort and customization without looking too clunky and big. Sadly that mouse is discontinued and now over $400. I didn't think I'd find any mouse with a close enough feel to really lived up to that expectation but I was super pleasantly surprised to find this older model. It looks and feels great, the customization on the keys is a little behind but it makes up for it with adjustable weight. It is slightly thinner on the right side than the 710 so I am still getting used to my pinky touching the mouse pad. I hope this one stays in production. Probably going to purchase a few more just in case.Edit: This mouse did not last nearly as long as my previous ones had. Several months ago the LMB has gotten worse it no longer stays down to drag/select and randomly double clicks instead of single clicking. Trying one more time before I update this review again.","January 5, 2020",2
Kittoa,Double Clicking Issues persists.,"Before I start, I've had this mouse for a year now. I've replaced it twice already for the same issues.PROS:- Fits my hand like a glove (its small and doesn't hurt my wrist)- Its a pretty looking mouse.- The scroll wheel is really fun to fidget with. Also extremely useful when I'm reading webtoons.CONS:- For some reason, after 2-3 months of use,  it just won't hold the left click button. While playing FPS games, I wouldn't shoot because it wouldn't register that I've clicked. Don't get me started trying to click+drag, it won't work. I've replaced this stupid mouse and spoken to customer service several times over the issue. Got a new mouse, after a month or so it gets the same issue.-The bottom picks up dust.  like...ALOT of dust. Its a hassle to clean, and impossible to clean without an airblaster. There's too many tiny crevices for dirt/dust to pick up.I loved this mouse...when it worked. But it keeps breaking and I'm over it.","December 21, 2020",1
Kevin Bérard,Get what it sells for and more,"I was not expecting this kind of comfort from the mouse. Furthermore all the other fonctions work really well and key binding are easy to set up. I was dubious about the wireless tech, but well I'm impress on that front too. The only thing I had problem with is that the mouse was not compatible with the old logitech gaming software. I had to install one software for my G510 keyboard and another for the mouse.","September 16, 2020",5
Max,"Lights, weights, buttons","The fanciest mouse I've owned, by far. Mainly bc I'm cheap and living a grad-student life. Anyways, the mouse is cool. It's comfy and my small hands fit nice.

I don't find it that heavy, but I also haven't added all the weights provided.It's a new addition for me so I haven't used it to it's full extent yet. But so far, so good.","August 28, 2020",5

All of them good mouses, but didn't come close to the comfort, ergonomics or practicality of the G602. Now, with the upgraded G604, this mouse is a must! All the cool features of the G604 and none of the let downs. Well except for that new software G Hub, very poor user interface and buggy. Hope Logitech will take lessons from their previous gaming software which was way better.","November 13, 2019",5

J. Lessard,Stopped working properly after a couple of months,"After a couple of months my mouse started doing double clicks instead of simple click, when pressing the left click button. That's particularly annoying when starting to select text or if creating a selection zone while editing an image. Because this unvoluntary double click will cancel what you were selecting. And first the glitch was rare, but at some point it was doing it for every click.I talked to other colleagues that got the same mouse, and they also had the same issue. They also told me that the customer was poor, They ask people to go to a specific websit and film themself while doing the action of clicking and send back the video plus the website results, that indicates the delays between those clicks. When I heard that I decided to not bother with customer support and simply call another mouse from a competitor. And give this faulty one to a relative that doesn't care about the double clicks (I think he didn't fully understood the implications of the issue thought)Logitech in my mind is supposed to be premium hardware, I was really disappointed about this issue.Otherwise, customization software and comfort are really good.","January 29, 2021",1
Amazon Customer,Huge flaw that brings down an otherwise fantastic product,"The product itself is solid gaming mouse, but the LEFT CLICK started double clicking within 10 months of daily use. My line of work requires precise clicking and the double clicking affects work too.Its really a shame because the product itself I believe is incredible and very precise, the feel is also really good and the price point is also a huge sell, but the double clicking ruins the product for me, as it has for many other reviews on here.","September 27, 2021",2
Spike,The mouse is too small.,"The mouse is too small.

Amazon Customer,"Suffers from ""extra clicks"" problem","I have been using this mouse (wired version) pretty heavily for 10 months.

It's very inconsistent about it; sometimes it seems to happen on every click for a while, and for another while it goes away.Otherwise I like the mouse a lot. Very comfortable for my medium-sized hands using a claw grip. Buttons are light and precise. Frictionless wheel toggle is a nice (and rare) feature. Giving it 2 stars only because I loved the shape and function of the mouse until now. Such basic quality issues with a mouse of this price is pretty unacceptable.

Has a pretty decent range for adjustable weight though even without any of the added weights its a bit on the heavier side.Good number of remappable buttons, most of which are fairly easy to trigger without thinking too hard about it.The lights are lights, if thats your thing, it has em.However I am not satisfied with it's life span. I bought it under 2 years ago, and (after tax) paid over 100$ for it. The right mouse button switch has recently failed, which considering the importance of the button is unacceptable.

Chen Rao,A very nice mouse.,"This mouse is one of the best all-around gaming mice there are. It has many programmable macro keys all over the place, has DPI changers, and has 2 mouse wheel scroll modes (one clicky and one smooth). For the price, the amount of functions that this mouse has is amazing. The only problem I can think of is the fact that the mouse wheel rattles VERY SLIGHTLY when you move the entire mouse from side to side. In the other aspects such as ergonomics, durability, and versatility, there are no problems whatsoever.","July 25, 2019",5
Amazon Customer,Best Mouse for the price range i've used,"Love this mouse. I game a lot and it's customizable with some extra buttons but not too many, I also like to change the weight to match my play style. There's not much for lighting (just the ""G"" symbol lights up) but it matches my keyboard so i'm good. I owned a G500 for over 5 years and this has been a great replacement. Might be a bit small for people with fairly large hands though. I got it on sale and worth every penny.","November 9, 2019",5

Theresa,I'm rating this as a one for tilt wheel functionality,"This mouse is actually fantastic for me, except for one TERRIBLE FLAW.  First the good - it's sleek, the sensor is amazing, it feels bonkers great in the hand, and the thumb buttons are very well positioned.  I kept reading a lot of things about the scroll wheel, but I didn't find it distracting at all.  I can't really see a use for free-scrolling, but the standard incremental scrolling works quite well.Now, for the bad.  The TILT WHEEL FUNCTIONALITY is absolutely useless if you are thinking of re-mapping the tilt buttons.  The slightest, most minimal application of pressure to the scroll wheel will often trigger the tilt buttons.  I repeat - if you use mouse button 3, you will FREQUENTLY trigger tilt left and right.  This means the tilt wheel is useless if you plan to re-map the tilt buttons (which I personally always do).  So, if you are never going to change the tilt wheel mapping - great mouse!  Fantastic deal!  If you don't want to be moving backwards and forwards in your browser every time you mouse 3, or want to re-map the tilt buttons - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOUSE.  COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY","April 19, 2019",1

Amazon Customer,Scroll Wheel Fail,"When using the G502 with the scroll wheel set to free mode, there is a very loud and distracting rattling sound when moving the mouse around. Very bad design flaw.Also note that when using the scroll wheel in step mode, it takes a considerable amount of force to scroll compared to other mice. This can be good or bad depending on personal taste.Build quality and responsiveness are very good.I don't know if it's normal, but the right-click button is much louder and feels much less smooth than the left-click button, which is very quiet.G-HUB app is not very intuitive to use either, all settings can be changed but it is not user friendly at all.","December 10, 2020",2

Pour ma part, ce sera la dernière fois que j'achèterai une sourie logitech, la qualité de leur produit est sérieusement à baisse.Évaluation initial: Plus petite que la g 500s, donc un peu moins confortable pour moi, la roulette est de moins bonne qualité et la petite porte sous la sourie comporte un peu d'espacement, ce qui fait que lorsque la sourie est déplacé de droite à gauche rapidement et sur une petite surface, il est possible de sentir celle-çi percuter les contours de la sourie où l'espacement le permet.

Vitamin B,Great mouse if you want to replace one every 1-2 years.,"I love the mouse, how it feels and how it works. It's responsive and easy to use WHEN it works. After just just over a year the mouse started losing ""drag"", meaning when I try to drag something across the screen, it will drop it all of a sudden without you releasing the left mouse button. I find if you press it harder, a lot harder, then it tends to hold the drag, but that's not how a mouse should work. Then it also started to double-click. Even the right button double-clicks at times!!! Tried all the different USB ports, no change. I never had a mouse that double-clicked both left and right buttons, and also was losing drag, all at the same time and just in mere a bit over a year!!!! This mouse is junk.Software is also needs improvement. It supposed to switch customization between your applications automatically, but it doesn't always do that. Sometimes you have to go manually switch it. Very annoying when I'm going between Photoshop and Chrome all the time.","March 4, 2021",1

Joseph Finnuk,"Great feel, excellent adjustable weight","I needed a weighted mouse for ergonomic reasons and this one hit a home run with that. with 5 adjustable weights it's perfect to customize it to your needs.

Dylan L.,went through 2 Replacement processes,"I bought the mouse and it was all fine and dandy, until the left mouse button went into double click death mode, I did the test and they sent out another one I just had to wait and it was delivered to me without needing to send back my broken one so I could use that in the meantime but I also ordered a Razer Essential for the downtime. Then the replacement started acting up and going crazy on me and the return process changed where I had to record my click video on their click test and upload to youtube (people must have been trying to take advantage of the easy replacement process) and they deemed I needed a third mouse. so repeat step from last and now I'm on this one. It has yet to act up and I'm sure the warranty is now over on it so when it does go left mouse click death thanks to the Omron switch I'll run and grab my Razer in the meantime. Other than all that it's a solid 10/10 mouse for everyday things and I have no real complaints.","October 14, 2020",1
Shafiq Ehsan,Double Clicking,"I loved the g502 proteus spectrum, and love this Hero edition as well. my problem is that 2 months after my purchase my left click devoloped the ever so famous double clicking problem. not a huge deal as logitech has a 2 year hardware warranty, and they were quick to send out a new g502 hero.","April 25, 2019",4

Travis Good,Outstanding hand feel,"Much more comfortable than my Razor or even the previous Logitech. The scroll wheel has a button you can click to switch between ultra-smooth scrolling and clicky scrolling, which is pretty cool. Also, the scroll wheel supports horizontal scrolling!

Jason,"Great, but it breaks easily","I bought this mouse off of amazon to play games like geometry dash and league of legends, both of which rely a lot on mouse quality. It was great, it fit my hand, and I loved the number of buttons there were. However, after about 2 months of having it, it began to develop a delay. As a gamer it became increasingly annoying and hard to play with. Now at about 3 months of having it, it is virtually unusable for geometry dash. Since this is a relatively expensive mouse, I tried my best to take care of it, and I don't think I should've done anythign that was enough to create this problem on a mouse that is supposed to be of top quality. Overall, I loved the mouse but I don't think the amount of money I spent was worth how long I was able to use this for.","August 10, 2019",2

Dwizzle,Not So Great As Everyone Thinks.,"I always liked logitech mice but the G502 is not as great as everyone thinks it is. If you have medium to large hands, steer clear of this mouse. Its narrow and hard to get a comfortable grip. After just an hour of using my hand was hurting. The side buttons are not placed well. Larger hands will find it harder hitting the back button of the mouse and your thumb will pretty much rest on the sniper button, causing it to be hit all the time by mistake. The scroll wheel needs a rubber coating over it. Right now the way it is your finger will slip over it if you don't press with enough pressure while trying to scroll. Anyways this mouse would be okay if a few things were fixed. Maybe in the future we'll see a G502 XL version. But right now this mouse Is definitely not made for medium to larger hands and is far from comfortable. Sent it back a few days later.","December 11, 2018",2
Ernest,The cord is poor quality. mouse is now garbage..,"After a couple months of light duty use the cloth cord wrapping wore out causing the inner cord to bulge out the hole.Now after a year the wheel press button is too easily activated (there is no click, it just activates) and you are constantly unintentionally pushing it and auto-scrolling web pages - The mouse is basically ready for the bin.  The software is incomprehensible and  unituative.  The magnetic closure for the weights is not strong enough and will fall appart with little provocation.This is not good enough to justify the price.","April 20, 2021",2
Levente Sardi,Double clicks after a year,Bought this for my girlfriend. Expensive mice like this shouldn't be double-clicking after a year. And I bet that's planned that it falls right out of guarantee time. Don't recommend this mouse for long term intensive use.,"January 23, 2022",2

SS,Terrible software design and broken on-board storage systems. Stay away.,"If you want this for Macros or connecting to other devices with bluetooth stay away.It requires the GHub software which is completely broken. Half the macros don't write to the onboard storage and there's no way of knowing which ones these are.It's impossible to transfer profiles between PCs without an account and even then you can't disable the ""default"" profile on the new pc so you end up with an extra blank profile.A lot of the key macros won't work without Logitech's G Hub software active and running, so say goodbye to using it with your phone.The software is painfully slow. Searching a menu can take 10-15 seconds, and you'll need to do it several dozen times.Complete garbage. Whoever developed the software for this mouse is incredibly underqualified or is actively trying to sabotage the brand.","December 30, 2020",1

Amazon Customer,Don't use this if you have big hands,"The DPI up/down buttons just left of the left mouse button are CONSTANTLY being accidentally bumped, and it doesn't take much pressure to activate them.  It's annoying as hell when your DPI changes randomly in a match.  I disabled the buttons with the G HUB software, but unless you have that software running in the background, the button binds are activated.  One time it randomly even reactivated the buttons then deactivated them again once I hit the button, which then locked my DPI in a funky spot.  REALLY annoying. I'm officially done with Logitech mice.","March 11, 2021",2
Amazon Customer,Excellente souris,"Vraiment confortable pour la main. Seul bémol: la molette métallique. Une surface au moins partiellement caoutchoutée faciliterait les choses. La molette offre une résistance telle lorsqu'on veut la faire tourner que le doigt glisse trop facilement sur sa surface plutôt que de la faire tourner, pour peu qu'on ait la peau sèche. Évidemment le bouton de débrayage qui met la molette en rotation libre est un incontournable. Malgré ce petit souci, une super souris.","August 24, 2019",5

Anthony R,Beware the build quality changed for the worse and this limited time lower price reflects that.,"I've bought 2 G502's in the past becasue they were good mice. I saw there was a limited time price drop and thought amazon was trying to clear out some old stock so I wanted to nab a backup, but looks like the mouse's quality just dropped a lot since 2 years ago.-No braided cable (They used to have braided cables)-switches sound & feel worse-there's still flash on the plastic molding (right under the palm where you will notice it constantly)-the plastic sounds hollow/cheap when you tap it-overall feels lighter-the button that locks and unlocks the scroll wheel feels incredibly more worse, longer travel time and feels ambiguous if it locked or notThe last one I had is still solid just a bit dirty from years of constant use. From my first impressions of the newer ones I'm skeptical on how long it will last and what other internals where swapped out for cheaper parts to match the new price.They were $79cad but the recent one I bought was dropped to $49cad and it feels like an average cheaper mouse now. Huge disappointment.","December 27, 2019",1

But the cover where the weights go doesn't align properly and rubs against my finger and is quite annoying. It also randomly lets go of the left mouse button (M1) sometimes for no reason when i hold it down. I have to put in a lot of pressure onto the button for it to stay on properly but that causes strain on my hand. Other than those two issues that came, it feels just like my G502 Spectrum and is super comfortable and nice to use.","April 17, 2020",2

Jeremy,Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of the G602, I've had one for years and finally thought it was time to upgrade to a new sensor. This seemed like the best option seeing as it just seemed like an upgraded version of the 602, but they changes a few things and it completely ruined it for me. It's slightly shorter with a higher arch, the plastic all around feels cheaper and the scroll wheel is really loose sided to side so even with just slight movements it clicks/thuds around all the time and it's really annoying. Also mine shipped with a seemingly broken sensor that has to be pushed into my mouse mat to register anything. Like I said, quite disappointing.","December 16, 2019",2

I contacted them and explained the situation, and instead of a solution to my issue, they gave me a gauntlet of tasks to put my defective mouse through to convey to them that it was indeed faulty, including making a video for them, which I refused citing that it was ridiculous.Would not recommend this mouse, or any Logitech product.

For the first mouse I thought I got a bad apple and gave it another chance but it turns out the issue is much more widespread.It's a shame since I used this line of products (Logitech G5, G500s, G502) for a very long time and the G5/G500s lasted 4-5 years.It's good while it lasted but I would NOT recommend this mouse as it doesn't last longer than a couple of months.","March 21, 2021",1

I decided to treat myself to this one, however...it's less than a year in, and currently i'm having issues.I'm 10 months in and when I try and drag and drop...the left click when you push down intermittently releases and clicks down again, cause copy pasting, dragging files, etc, just a pain.  At this point i'm going to have to set it aside and go back to my cheap logitech mouse.  Not worth the price if it can't last longer than their cheap brand.","May 14, 2020",2

However, I like the ergo so much I bought another one. The second one I bought had a loose scroll wheel, and upon further research this is apparently a common issue. Moving the mouse left to right would rattle the wheel, not only making an annoying sound but I could also feel the wheel moving around, which was also annoying.","September 21, 2020",2

Set it up and it seemed to be fine, however within a very short period the mouse wheel started spinning freely. Its not that it was simply clicked down like most mice, it is in fact broken. I just spent 25 minutes on Logitechs site trying to initiate a warranty claim, and ended up having to open a support ticket to log my complaint so its going to take a while I am sure. I have always purchased Razer products in the past but thought I would give Logitech a try.

Phillip W.,Right Click is unresponsive,"The G502 series is infamous for having a faulty right click. It will not register clicks, or not be able to hold a right click.

I can't drag and drop, I can't drag anything, I can't hold the mouse button in game, I can't hold the mouse in editor programs. It's not my computer and the mouse clearly doesn't work well at all.

Kent,Logitechs software ruins this mouse,"The mouse itself is mostly okay, the mouse wheel isn't well made but that isn't a deal breaker.

I regret not thinking to research the software before buying.Do yourself a favor and google search G Hub to try and see if it's still messy, broken software before buying into Logitech.

Nadine,Well known manufacturing defect: erroneously reporting double-clicks,"The mouse worked well for around 9 months before I encountered the well known and documented issue of the mouse erroneously reporting double-clicks on single left clicks. I followed the various troubleshooting steps published by Logitech on forums like Reddit, but all failed to address the issue. Apparently, the root of the problem is physical faults in the switches themselves. The issue gets worse over time. While Logitech is willing to replace the mouse under warranty, the best you'll get is another G502 Hero which has the same risk of having faulty switches. If you're interested in reliability and longevity, I suggest buying a different product.","March 9, 2021",1

Amazon Customer,Double Clicks,"I loved this mouse when I first got it, Worked perfectly fine for around  3 months and then just randomly started double-clicking, ruining games, basically made games unplayable, I did find a workaround and actually why it double clicks, It is because you are pressing too hard on the mouse, MICE SHOULD BE able to handle this kind of pressure but the Logitech G502 Seems to be an expectation with the double-clicking ISSUE happening DUE to pressing too hard on the mouse IF you get this mouse, be VERY careful this may happen and may ruin the mouse for you.","March 14, 2021",1
Mike,It could have been perfect,Everything about this mouse is great except for the thing you use the most.  The scroll wheel is terrible.  It is plastic like something you would get on a $5 mouse.

rklimes,"A bit small, unintentional double clicking is common","Overall it's an okay mouse, with one nagging issue.The mouse registers double clicking, on a single click fairly regularly.

Mike Jenkins,Good Mouse - Bad Software (G Hub),"Logitech in their wisdom decided to not allow this mouse to be supported by their stable Logitech Gaming Software (LGS).

The metal wheel feels a little cheap since it as a tendency to wobble and make a little bit of noise when you use the mouse a little more intensely (such as while gaming). I personally do not use all of the extra buttons on the mouse, so if I could come back in time, I would buy a different mouse (lighter and fewer buttons), but that's just a matter of preference.","November 29, 2022",4

Trisch,Great for gaming and in the office,"I've had this mouse now for almost 2 years and I do not regret buying it one bit. I originally picked it for the custom keys on the side of it and because it can also connect via bluetooth. It allows me to use it on both my laptop and ipad pro easily (click a button to switch between usb dongle and bluetooth, wait a sec, and go).I use some of the custom buttons for stuff I do in excel that don't have good shortcuts built in. I simply add it to the quick access bar in excel, then note the alt # for it and add that alt+# to one of my mouse custom buttons and I'm good to go.I ended up falling in love with the free wheel on this. I normally don't like free wheels, but the click on this wheel has WAYYY too much resistance on it and is too loud, so I started using it in free wheel mode instead and it ended up growing on me.Speaking of loud, the button clicks also are a bit louder than I would prefer for a quiet office environment, but now with working from home, I don't care lol. But when I'm working somewhere else for the day that is quiet, I'm pretty self conscious of it.Overall, this mouse moves so nicely!!! Having the 4 contact pads makes more of a difference than I was expecting. I love that if I have someone else come to my computer to do something, I can instantly drop the DPI on it with a click, so that they aren't scrambling with my super high setting lol (even with as amusing as it is to watch).The battery life on this is really good for everything this mouse does. My old ms bluetrack mouse would last about 4 months on a single battery which I loved about it, and this mouse keeps up with that. When I was working full-time 100% on my computer, my battery (single AA) was lasting me about 3 months on this mouse. Now with my lesser schedule, I'm getting an extra month out of it. I do however only use energizer (sometimes disposable, sometimes rechargeable - same lifespan out of both). It's a far cry from my old old mouse which would eat through 2 AA's in a month.It took a bit to get used the grip on this mouse. I have small hands, so I'm used to mice being a bit big for my hand (this one isn't which is nice), but what surprised me was the thumb grip. It curves too far into the side of the mouse so I feel like I'm constantly squeezing the mouse instead of being able to let my thumb rest on the ledge. It's not awful, but it is weird lol. I do really like the thumb ledge though. Maybe one day my hand will relax enough to use it :PI like that this mouse saves settings profiles directly to the device, it means I don't have to have the LG app running in the background to still make use of all of my custom settings and buttons. My biggest pet peeve is background apps eating up resources, so this avoids that.One of my wishes though is that I could program it to start apps that I've installed from the microsoft store. But because the folder those exe's are stored in is protected, I can't access it in the LG app. Works great for normal installed programs though!Overall, one of the best tech purchases I've made in the last few years. Wish I would have made the switch so much sooner!!","July 20, 2022",5

Grant R,"The design is very flawed, and it's frustrating to use","I've been using this mouse for almost 1 year, and I'm getting extremely annoyed with it.  I plan on replacing it as soon as I find something suitable.- The included software is absurdly large, overly complex, unintuitive, and I honestly don't want it on my PC at all- The DPI button is located exactly where the tip of your thumb sits, this makes absolutely no sense.  Why would I ever want my DPI button to be accessible like that?  It gets accidentally pressed very often- When I do accidentally press the DPI button, I have absolutely no idea which DPI level I've changed it to, and I have no indication of how to get back to the one I was using.  Logitech has some absurd LED colour patterns on the side of the mouse that presumably indicate which mode I've switched to, but they offer no documentation on what these patterns/colours mean, so I'm lost- The Mouse Wheel offers 2 modes, a rigid mode where the wheel has tactile grooves that click when you notch the wheel in either direction, and also a smooth free-spinning mode.  The clicky mode is insanely firm and difficult to move the wheel.  It took almost 3 months of use for the wheel to ""wear down"" and it finally seems somewhat normal.- The clicky mode of the mouse wheel is VERY loud when you scroll.  The clicks can be heard in the bedroom next to my office- The software for the mouse is very buggy on Windows 10, so I've uninstalled it.  It was resulting in the mouse occasionally causing an issue where various menus in Windows would continually scroll downwards.  Like the Start Menu.  It made it impossible to use my computer.  Tried updating, same issue.I find it incredibly annoying that Gaming mouse manufacturers can't make a product that can be used properly without running trash software on my computer.  I definitely won't be buying any Logitech gaming mice again.","October 3, 2022",2

Gregory Smart,Favorite mouse - one really annoying part though,"This is my favourite mouse, used it for years, been through 3 of them. This is the major problem I wish they would fix: They apply stickers to the bottom to hide screws. After use, the stickers wear down, attract dust/goo etc. Eventually they start rubbing off on your mouse pad too. It is really annoying and they are really hard to get off without leaving a gooey under-bottom to the mouse, which makes the mouse not move smoothly. Each time I have replaced the mouse - it has because these disintegrating stickers have become too annoying. To be honest, not sure I will buy the same mouse next time because of it - might try something else. Just keeps happening.","April 23, 2022",4

Razvan,Great mouse overall although quality seems to be going down,"I used to have a G502 Proteus Spectrum which was amazing, by far one of the best mice I've owned. After almost 3 years of pretty intensive use (8hrs+/day) it finally died. Luckily I was able to get my original G502 RMA'ed and they sent me a new G502 Hero instead. Back then the warranties were 3 years, now they've dropped that to 2 years which I guess puts then in line with other mouse manufacturers. The new G502 Hero lasted 14 months with the same amount of use as the old mouse before it started having issues. I ran into 3 issues, all related to the left click button which made the mouse unusable pretty fast. It would randomly stop registering ""clicks and hold"" say you're dragging a file on your desktop, it'll drop the file, sometimes it would click on something else, it wouldn't register certain clicks at all and finally instead of a single left click it would register a double click at times. All these issues happened pretty rarely at first, but then over the spam of a month went from a slight annoyance to literally happening 90% of my clicks. After looking it up online I saw other posts talking about this same issue and it would apparently be related to poor switches and seems to be a pretty common among users. Overall the mouse is great when it works, the ergonomics are amazing, the software features although not as good as Razor's are still very good, my only disappointment so far are the seemingly poor quality switches which is unfortunate considering this product is aimed for enthusiasts and isn't exactly cheap.","November 27, 2021",4

kyle,The perfect mouse,"This mouse is amazing, a little expensive but worth it. It's large so it fits perfectly to my hand, all the clicks are satisfying and I rarely had misclicks unless I panic and spam. The sheer amount of buttons and macros you can set with the ""G-Shift"" function is amazing. I can pause/play, skip/reverse music, turn up/down the volume, copy/paste, forward/back the page all by clicking the other buttons I set on my mouse. Even if you aren't an intense gamer this is still amazing for convenience and productivity. It is a little heavy but the weight shouldn't matter unless you plan on flinging your hand across the table. It is very well built with good quality materials. I've had it for 4 years and the only sign of wear is the slightly softer rubber on the left where the thumb rests rubbing out a little bit. I do have the older version with the old logo so I'm not sure if they changed the material but I still love it. Dead skin and other stuff on your hands do build up a bit around the buttons but just use a Q-tip whenever you notice it and it's gone. Never had any problems with the software either, it's very simple to use. Honestly, this mouse might be unfair since in all my games I set one of the macros to the crouch button so instead of moving my thumb from the space bar to find ""C"" or whatever is to crouch I just shift my thumb on the mouse ever so slightly and crouch a lot faster and easier. There's really not a reason not to get this mouse unless you need portability or you have small hands. Razer has a clone of this mouse too if you are interested in that you can take a look. They have extra rgb lights on the more expensive models but all of them are missing the two buttons next to the left click and I do use those quite often but it's all preference. I will die by this mouse.","September 23, 2021",5
Michael O,"Decent Mouse, Crap Software","I find this mouse fairly poor when trying to move the mouse small distances - there's some minimum threshold of movement before anything registers.  Otherwise the mouse is good, but I still find this frustrating and it happens even on something simple like selecting text to copy.The GHUB software is awful: your DPI settings aren't applied until it manages to start... sometimes in a few seconds, sometimes a minute.  It's not THAT long, but infuriating day after day, every single time.  There's a reddit post you can find with some searching that explains the multiple obscure steps you have to jump through to avoid this problem that should be set by default.This mouse is holding up after 1.5 years (purchased Nov2020, this review Apr2022).","April 9, 2022",3

baconducttape,An update to the G602 which addresses some some issues but creates new ones,"I bought this as an upgrade/replacement to my G602 which I used for about 2.5 years until the scroll wheel click started failing.The G604 fixes a few of the flaws with the G602. The good:- The side buttons on the 602 are very sharp, become uncomfortable to use in long gaming sessions. The 604 has slightly flatter buttons which are more comfortable.- 602 goes through 2x AA batteries in about 20-30 days, even in 'eco' mode. The 604 has 1x AA slot and is more power efficient. Still a major negative to not be rechargeable.- The 602 lacked a scroll wheel clicky-to-spin toggle. The 604 adds this.- There is not slot in the mouse of the USB dongle, the 604 adds this.- The left click side buttons (G11 and G10 on the 602) feel very flimsy and sometimes don't register. The 604 buttons are much sturdier.- The feet/pads on the 604 don't collect nearly as much dust as the 602.- The 604 adds Bluetooth connectivity, in addition to the USB gaming dongle.- The 604 also adds support for G Hub, whereas the 602 doesn't work naively with G Hub (though you can manually add the drivers).The bad:- The 604 is smaller than the 602. I have averaged sized hands it is far less comfortable.- The main with the layout is now my thumb is 'pintched' by the side buttons with a normal grip on the 604. On the 602, there is enough room/space between the side buttons and the thumb rest.- To avoid getting my thumb pinched I have to move my hand further back on the mouse and use hy thumb/finger tips more, which is not as comfortable.- The back of the mouse slopes away much faster (and/or the overall mouse is shorter) than the 602, so this further exacerbates the above issue.- I personally don't like the level of scroll wheel clickyness, I think its too aggressive. I also think the texture of the scroll wheel 'notches' are too deep.- The 604 takes a single AA. This is just a huge f-up by Logitech to not make it rechargeable, creates so much unnecessary e-waste, inconvenience, and a completely avoidable running cost of buying batteries. This is such a 2003 move.Finally, as usual, the largest failing of any Logitech gaming peripheral is the software. G Hub is, to be frank, complete and utter garbage. I don't use game switching profiles (not useful to me, but also it does't always detect the game properly), so I use persistent profiles. Call of Duty detects my button configuration no issue, World of Warcraft detects some but not all buttons.Overall, I would not recommend this product. If you are someone who wants a mouse with more than 2 side buttons then this is a decent buy but is really the only selling point for this mouse. If you have large hands you will probably hate this mouse.I will no longer purchase any Logitech gaming peripherals. Between my experience with the G602/G604 and the G933 headset which I also, I have been really disappointed.","September 3, 2020",3
justnanastuff,The kids are finding the wifi option more effective for gaming.,Most of the kids seem to like this as long as they are using it for gaming. ( we are talking about young teenagers)They had a few issues with the software during set up but got it straightened out after a short time and things were pretty good to go after that.At first they all said this felt comfortable in their hand and it was pretty speedy as long as they didn't switch to blue tooth.Blue tooth seemed to slow things down and would dropped a few times.Our wi fi connection is very good so using Bluetooth wasn't continued.After a few days off and on using this Logitech G604 some of them said that they preferred the older one that they have in their own homes.Honestly not sure if that was just because they were more used to the older version or there was a design difference that they noticed when holding/using it.Those teens just said that the old one 'feels better'.The option buttons on the side were convenient and easy to access.Most of the kids said that the spin wheel seemed to rattle a lot when they were using it so they turned its' motion option off.It apparently was still a little noisy but didn't sound as if it was about to break or anything.All of them said it was a little goofy the way the battery was housed.(We feel that might have been because they had to stop and think about where to look instead of just popping off the bottom plate as with their other mice.) The overall reaction to this mouse was that it was a reasonably good mouse and would just take some getting used to hearing it rattle.,"January 8, 2020",4
Truthful Reviewer,"Ergonomic Grip, Light in Weight & Performs Exceptional (pics and video included)","                    The media could not be loaded.                 [Introduction – Opening Statement] I had the opportunity to use the 'Logitech G604 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse' for several days. My review includes pictures of the product, in addition to a video overview and my personal experience as a user. [Experience Using Product] The Logitech G604 offers an excellent ergonomic grip and feels both premium and comfortable around the hand. In order for the mouse to function, the set-up process is a breeze; the bottom portion of the mouse has a removable plastic cap, which allows you to insert a single AA battery and also remove the Bluetooth transmitter which is stored beside the battery compartment.Note - Make sure the battery is installed with the top facing your direction.The Bluetooth transmitter can connect directly in a USB port of your desktop or laptop, otherwise you can use the extension cable provided if your computer is too far in distance from your mouse, as you want to ensure the transmitter is near the proximity of your mouse and in visual range with limited obstructions to ensure you have a smooth game play experience with no interruptions. As for the battery life, it's rated at an incredible 240 hours, which in itself is phenomenal. Replacing the battery is easy; you can either use a one-time use battery or a rechargeable battery to save on costs over-time.As for the button mapping and configuration, Logitech required you to download software from their site called G Suite (Windows and OSX compatible). Once installed, the software detects the mouse and  you can begin mapping the buttons and functions within minutes, so long as your mouse is ON and the Bluetooth receiver is connected in your USB port.Now for the mouse wheel ...it's hands-down the best in the business. I love Logitech's mouse wheel, as it lets you spin the wheel once and it continues rolling until you stop it, this feature alone is one of my favourites. Whether you are working in excel, word or even surfing web-pages, having the ability to hyper stroll is an incredible experience. If you do not like this feature, you can de-activate it using a button on the mouse, which turns the wheel into a conventional mouse, whereas the wheel spins in increments.I spent about 10 hours of gaming in FPS, MMORG and RTS games thus far using this mouse and it's been a perfect experience.***Positive*** +240 Hours of Battery Life+Ergonomic Grip+15 Buttons to Program (*must download Logitech G Suite*)+Hyper Scrolling Mouse Wheel+Zero Lag or Delays+Bluetooth Adapter Included+Battery Included+Storage Compartment Within Mouse for Bluetooth Adapter (prevents losing it!)***Negative***During my initial review, I was unable to detect any negative experiences using this gaming mouse; in the event this changes, I will update my review.   [Conclusion – Final Thoughts]Finding the perfect gaming mouse is not an easy task; for those who are gamers, you are familiar with the ""claw mouse"" preference. This means when I move my gaming mouse, I lift it up to relocate on my mousepad - this is the only way I like my gaming mouse. Because the G604 doesn't weigh much and wraps around your hand easily due the ergonomic grip, I am able to gaming in this fashion, which is a huge plus.I've been thoroughly been enjoying gaming and working excel/word docs on this mouse and would definitely recommend it. You don't have to be a gamer to enjoy this mouse - I use it for office/admin work and it makes long days working on documents more enjoyable and tolerable.","November 3, 2019",5
ChrisN,great to work with as well,"I'm not a big gamer anymore, so my gaming is limited to playing my old COD single player games.The G604 seriously kicks in smoothness. The tracking on this mouse os out of this world.Two  of the the buttons by default, can switch the dpi (every inch you move the mouse will move the cursor on screen a certain amount, and you can change that with a click).After my initial gaming testing, I used the G604 at work, since I work in advanced microelectronics and draw transistors and devices all day; We have a very strict policy here on downloads. I could not install the G-suite to configure the mouse (permissions).MAJOR bummer is that you do not get software with this package, you have to download a setup file which then connects online to install the G-suite.I contacted Logitech support about this and they told me that I can install and configure the G604 at home, and because the mouse has its own bios and on board memory, IT CAN REMEMBER SETTINGS!!I saved a profile on the mouse's onboard memory, and when i got to work, it remembered my keybinds! Wonderful.I have a large hand (I'm 6'3"") and the mouse feels absolutely fantastic. It glides so smoothly.Another setback is that I couldn't get it to connect via bluetooth on my old laptop (an old ACER).Overall, the G604 feels great, moves so smoothly, has very customizable buttons, but the software for it is not that easy to navigate.  It took me a while to figure out how to save the settings into the mouse, and that's only because tech support told me it was possible.This mouse performs really well, but the software package could use some work.","November 11, 2019",4
SuperE,Great hardware let down by clunky software,"******** Quick Rating ********Pros:+ Very low latency mode (Lightspeed)+ Can be connected via Bluetooth.+ Pairing can be split between two computers (one using lightspeed and one using Bluetooth)+ All buttons can be fully customized (see cons)+ Uses a single AA battery (included)+ Battery life using Bluetooth is approx. 5 months; Using Lightspeed it's around 240 hours.+ Scroll wheel can be switched between smooth ""infinity"" scrolling and ratcheting mode at the push of a button.+ 16K sensor for incredible tracking.+ Very comfortable ergonomics.Cons:-G-Hub software is bad.- Programming the buttons is not intuitive.- Profile switching has been hit and miss.- No battery level indicator on the mouse (you have the check the software or your Bluetooth panel).- Unsure if there's a standby feature (no mention of it anywhere), so the unit should be manually turned on/off when needed (button on the bottom).- No option to customize the weight of the mouse.****************************Logitech makes some great products for gamers, and the G604 mouse is right up there with one of their best - at least, as far as the hardware is concerned.The package is nicely branded and small. Included in the box you get a pairing guide, some marketing material, a ""G"" logo sticker, a battery, and a USB cable for the Lightspeed dongle (between 5-6'). The Lightspeed dongle is housed inside the mouse and can be easily removed by opening the battery compartment cover.There is no software included in the box and you have to download the G-Hub software from Logitech's website.G-Hub controls the settings for all of your Logitech devices like mice, keyboards, lighting, etc. It's clunky to use and I found it frustrating to work with.With the G-Hub software, you're able to assign various profiles for various games and software. This is pretty standard for most gaming mice as it allows you to customize the button layout for each different game. While the software does allow for profile switching between apps/games, I found that it was not very consistent and I would often have to manually switch profiles.When assigning buttons, rather than clicking on the button you'd like to remap and pressing a key, you have to go to a sidebar with a list of keys, key combinations, macros, etc. and drag and drop them to to the graphical representation of each button you want to change. On a 4k monitor, the button layout is very small, so dragging each key designation can be frustrating.The mouse itself feels really nice in the hand and it glides smoothly over my mousepad. FPS gaming has been no issue at all, and the responsiveness from both the Bluetooth and Lightspeed connection has been wonderful (although, I stick with Lightspeed when gaming).I have been able to pair this mouse with my Google Pixelbook (Chromebook) and Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ smartphone, but you can only pair to one device at a time via Bluetooth, so in reality, you are limited to using this mouse on one device via Bluetooth and a second device via the Lightspeed dongle.The scroll wheel is metal and has some weight to it, but you can switch on the fly between smooth ""roll to your heart's content"" mode and the traditional ratcheting scroll mode.The mouse features a single LED light under the connection switch button just below the scroll wheel. This indicator will turn cyan when connected to Lightspeed and Blue when on Bluetooth. It doesn't seem to indicate any other status'.I've had no issues with the connection performance, even from across the room, and the button clickiness is really satisfying.Overall, this is a wonderful gaming mouse that's been marred slightly by the software. It's not that the G-Hub isn't functional, it's that it's not user-friendly or intuitive, at least not when compared with other similar software from other brands.","November 4, 2019",4
The Tech Guy,"Uber Customizable, Highly Responsive Gaming Mouse","The two biggest features of this mouse are the 15 programmable controls and the option to connect via Bluetooth or USB using the Lightspeed Dongle.Customization:Hands down there are a lot of buttons on this mouse but strangely enough I didn’t find them getting in the way … when using the G604 as a regular mouse.  The real power of the G604 is the ability to customize the buttons on the mouse for either productivity work or gaming.  To do this you will need to download Logitech’s G-Suite Software.  Thankfully this is available in both Windows and OSX so it will work on Macs and PCs.Bluetooth - USB?Logitech gives you the ability to connect this mouse wirelessly to your computer either by Built In Bluetooth or Lightspeed USB Dongle.  Both wireless connections work well however for maximum sensitivity and responsiveness the Lightspeed Wireless USB connection is the best and my preferred connection for gaming.Overall I like design and fell of this mouse a lot.  For gaming it’s responsive with no lag and the customization options are fantastic.  I like the separate button to change the scroll wheel from Hyper-scrolling to standard scrolling and the quick change DPI button.Two features I found missing from the G604 was the ability to adjust the weight and the absence backlit buttons.  While I agree adding backlighting to a wireless mouse would decrease battery life having the option to do so would be beneficial.  Likewise there should be some way to adjust the weight.  While backlighting and weight aren’t standard features on regular mice, they are popular features for a gaming mouse.","November 5, 2019",4
Amazon Customer,"Great mouse, BUT","A mouse for big hands.  I have medium hands and my right click was fairly weak when using this mouse.  The mouse sensor is great and pretty much flawless.  I love mice with free scroll wheels and really like the weight of the metal scroll wheel.  The only thing I don't like is that the metal scroll wheel began to corrode after just over a years use and has begun to wobble.  Would I recommend this mouse?  Sure, but only if you can find a replacement scroll mechanism and are willing and capable to replace it on your own once a year.","February 4, 2021",4
Ahmed Rizvi,Gaming mouse only for the sensor,"This mouse works very well with a claw grip hold and has a good feel to it in the hand. Although this mouse is marketed for gaming, I think it works better for productivity than anything else. Its a little too heavy to play with for long periods of time.Battery life is amazing, I've been using the AA battery that it came with for 3 weeks and G HUB is still showing battery over 75%. This is while using the Lightspeed sensor at a 500 report rate.The buttons on the side are not really that good when playing games, as trying to press a button moves the entire mouse in my case.  I find them more useful when browsing the web or using IDEs.The frictionless scroll wheel is something I cannot live without anymore. This feature makes using the computer so much more enjoyable.When using the lightspeed sensor, I find it very hard to tell the difference between this mouse and a wired mouse. It's only when the mouse wakes up from sleep that I realize that its wireless.Overall great mouse, I will change my review if I start getting the infamous double clicking issue.","November 5, 2020",4
Hart,Excellent mouse but lousy scroll wheel,"If it wasn't for one major problem this would be an excellent gaming and all-around mouse.I've been using it now for a number of weeks, I don't believe in taking something out of a box then maybe using it once or twice before reviewing it. Unlike some reviewers here, I prefer to really test something like this to find the good and the bad points.The good stuff first:► Ergonomics is great► The action on each side and top-mounted button provides tactile feedback► Side button placement is perfect for me, my thumb rests right where the buttons are located.► Pads on the bottom are wide and glide smoothly across hard and soft mousepads.► I like that the scroll wheel can be set to run free or have indents.► Battery life has been excellent, better than I was expecting.► The outer body surfaces are a little smooth but there are enough ridges that the fingers can easily hold onto.► It doesn't matter what surface I used it on, it tracked correctly without any jumping.► The battery compartment also holds the USB adapter when traveling.► There is no lag, zero, nada, nichts, none, this is as fast as any cabled mouse I have ever used.► I don't mind that the power source is a AA battery, it's far quicker to swap out the battery when needed instead of looking for a USB cable to charge internal batteries. Rechargeable batteries work great.The not so great stuff:► The left and right mouse buttons are sort of soft. They do provide feedback but feel slightly mushy.The really bad stuff:► The big problem here is the scroll wheel. It's metal which would be ok ""if"" there was a rubber outer coating. We found that adult fingers are not soft enough to get a good grip on the wheel. Fingers slip off of it easily. Other Logitech offerings such as the G502 have it right.Using the GHub software allows for easy customization. There are preconfigured button settings and the ability to customize.As for another reviewer commenting on not being able to use the software on 32-bit machines, older systems (32 bit) won't run most of the newer games which would allow use of the various customizable buttons so this is a non-issue. That said, I was able to run the software without issue on a 32-bit version of Windows 7.I can't recommend this otherwise excellent mouse because of the cheap super slippery metal scroll wheel.","December 30, 2019",3
Jason Reid,Great mouse,"The DPI switch buttons are too easy to hit by accident, but they are easily re-assigned","December 4, 2021",3
Fat Rabbit,Feels Great in the hand,"I really loved 99% of what this mouse has to offer. The clicks feel good, the scroll wheel is precise but also free wheels for scrolling long long pdf files; the macro buttons on the side are the short coming of the mouse in my opinion.I couldn't get the feel for the macro buttons they felt like they were positioned too high up to access the top row, the keys are too small and cramped so I can't register the lower row with out mashing a couple of top macro keys. There's a lot of unused real estate on the mouse where they could have staggered the macro keys.Battery life should be excellent, even if it accomplishes 50% of what they claim, I'll be happy. A single AA battery for months and months of high performance use is incredible.Wireless performance was excellent in MW and Paladins, instant response time. I think they mouse is targeted for MOBA players but I found it to be an excellent all round mouse; since I was not comfortable with the macro keys, I found the mouse better suited to FPS games where there aren't many key bindings.Weight feels very good, balanced and easy to flick around, little to no fatigue in my hand after hours of gaming and photo editing.Would recommend as an all purpose mouse if keybindings aren't a big concern for you.","November 20, 2019",4
Jason R.,At the nexus between work and play.,"For a gaming mouse there is a notable lack of any kind of lighting that you almost take for granted on these things these days, not even the signature glowing G logo is to be found here.  It definitely makes for a more stealth mouse that isn't out of place being used in an office but I can't shake the strange feeling that it isn't powered on when I glance over at it, expecting to see LEDs all over it.Also notably absent on this mouse is any USB port.  There is no way to use this mouse ""wired"", nor does it have any facility to charge the battery inside (provided it's a rechargeable one, like some of my older mouse can do).  That being said, the battery life on the mouse is ridiculous any way you look at it so the point is completely academic and I understand why they didn't bother with the extra complication.My experience with the wireless performance is second to none with the Lightspeed connection.  As I do most of my PC gaming sitting on the sofa quite far away from the PC (I use a lapdesk) I can't imagine anybody having a more challenging situation for the wireless connection than mine and I cannot tell that it's not a wired mouse at all, not even in games like Quake Champions where even a little bit of latency matters. Full marks here. The new HERO sensor seems excellent though not a big upgrade over PMW3366 for me. The extra DPI range is not something I've found myself using and I found most comfortable sticking to 12K and adjusting in-game sensitivity to taste from there but this may just be out of habit and I'll have to spend some time seeing if transitioning to lower sensitivity and the 16K DPI feels better over time. Tracking is extremely smooth and precise and I never once felt like the mouse was getting in my way playing a competitive FPS.I like the shape of this mouse as an all rounder at a PC I use both for software development and gaming.  It's been comfortable enough to use all day long.  The fact that it has so many buttons on it hasn't got in my way, none of them touch my fingers when not intending to use them and outside of gaming I've found there are enough of them to set up useful macros in my development environment.  The ""back door"" where the battery is stowed has a cool magnetic closure, and I really appreciate the fact that there is a space in there to stow the lightspeed USB adapter for travel/storage so the two don't get separated or lost.  The G604 is quite heavy for what I'm used to for a gaming mouse, compared to G900/G502, and there is no way to adjust the weight.  If you like your mice very light, this might be a problem for you.While I don't intend to really use the bluetooth connection option, I did test it out by pairing it with my phone and the switchover between the lightspeed and USB works perfectly by just holding the connection button down on the top of the mouse for a couple of seconds.  I could see this coming in handy when working on multiple PCs at the same time or simply using the mouse for more than one purpose.  You can definitely feel a bit of latency when in bluetooth mode compared to lightspeed, I'm not sure I'd game with it in bluetooth unless absolutely necessary but it's perfectly usable for regular productivity and browsing and it's an option I can appreciate having there.The G604 is now my every day mouse.  I still prefer other mice for when I play AFPS games for their light weight mostly but for everything else including the day to day stuff that pays the bills I've been very happy with the G604 lightspeed.","November 2, 2019",5
Derek Dickinson,4 years of usage,"Over the 4 years of using this mouse I can say that it is a fantastic mouse for the price point the change in weight is great for each individual user of the mouse. Holds up for durability and comfort. After the first year of owning the mouse it is not great to wrap up the cord for travel as the weave on the cord unwinds itself. Other than that the programable buttons is great for any game your willing to play with any play style. I used mine for mmo, first person shooters, strategy games and so much more if you wnat a mouse that can last this is a great buy for the price point.0","November 5, 2020",4
Rachel,Excellent mouse...but there’s one small setback,"It fits and works just as well as my old G502 Proteus Core mouse. However, I can’t give it 5 stars for the one flaw it has. The scroll wheel has about 1mm gap on either side of it that makes it wiggle when you move the mouse rapidly from side to side or even wiggle it a bit. A bit disappointing when you pay a good amount for the mouse. I’m not sure if all the mice will have the issue. But a common issue found with the mouse, is the loose scroll wheel. I haven’t found anywhere online to fix the wheel issue even without taking the mouse apart (which id rather not do) so I’ve tried contacting Logitech through their site to see if the issue is in every mouse, or if it can be fixed without taking it apart.The Logitech GHub works pretty well with it to set up your specifics like RGB, DPI, multiple profiles and switch between the mouse’s on-board memory or the computer’s memory.The Led symbol and DPI indicator lights, are crisp and sharp with any colour you set it to between the static, breathing, or the colour shift it starts off on.All in all, the mouse is wonderful, and a nice upgrade to my Proteus Core. Just wish the scroll wheel didn’t have that loose wiggle. If that’s not a huge issue for you either, then I suggest the mouse or go for the Lightspeed if you have extra cash.","August 4, 2019",4
Austin,Great Physical Mouse - Terrible Software,"I have had several G502's over the past 8 years, and ever since last year a massive problem has begun.The software which controls all the mouse settings: DPI, presets, etc, BREAKS every single update. I have had to reinstall the software for this mouse 5+ times now to fix the issue, and the latest update re-installing doesn't even fix it. End result: an essentially bricked mouse because it doesn't go at the speed you want it to.Logitech used to be the best for quality. They have clearly gone down the hill over the years.","October 12, 2021",2
Chris B,"Better wireless and great tracking, worse everything elese","The Lightspeed wireless works beautifully.  I bought this to replace my g602, which had a lot of trouble maintaining a good connection with it's dongle, in the hopes that it would help, and I have to say for me it's working flawlessly.The tracking is also super smooth, no jumping/hesitations at all.On the downside it took a good hour to get this working properly as the old Logitech software for the 602 wouldn't recognize it, which I haven't seen documented anywhere.  After wasting time checking cables etc I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software as a last resort and that worked eventually.  Before it worked though it took a good half hour to download Logitechs bloatware on my 500Mbps line because the Logitech download app couldn't keep connected with the Logitech server.Generally the mouse looks and feels cheap, it's too light and the flat black design doesn't look simple or sleek, it just looks like they tried to squeeze every nickel out of it.The surface of the metallic scroll wheel is too slippery, a rubber wheel or grip would be much better.  Also the wheel occasionally binds when I press it.It's easy to accidently press the DPI setting buttons like on the G602, but where my old G602 had a clear 3 LED display to show what setting it's on this uses one tiny LED that uses random colors to indicate what setting it's on.  By the time I figure it out I'll be on my next mouse.Finally the buttons are the mushiest of the four Logitech mice I have, I can hear the click but there's not much to feel, kind of the opposite of what I'd really want.So a mixed bag.  As far as wireless and tracking it's the best mouse I've had, which is the most important thing, but it misses on all the little things.","December 2, 2020",3
Nathan,Had for not even 2 years and its broken,"I use it all the time and I love the feel of it and how precise it is, but it double clicks and now about 1/10 of the time my clicks don't register which is a huge deal, go for a different mouse","November 1, 2021",2
Amazon Customer,Amazing Battery Life!!!,"This mouse has really changed my perspective on wireless products.  Unfortunately, I have bought 2 wireless corsair mice prior to this one due to their sizes:  Dark Core RGB and Ironclaw Wireless.  Both nice were way too heavy, and the battery life sucked on those mice!  The fact that the G604 came with a removable li-ion battery is what makes this product a great one.  If you're looking to shave mass out of the mouse, make sure to get a AAA-battery and an adapter.  This will reduce the maximum battery life, but may reduce it to 10-12 days instead of 20-25 on light usage.  Also, what lends to the amazing battery life on this mouse is the fact that the mouse goes in to and out of idle perfectly.  There has been no performance drops as a result of this feature.  Kudos to Logitech!The ergonomics, while not perfect due to the fixed design and such, is not all that bad.  Whether you want to palm the mouse with a smaller hand or fingertip/claw with a larger hand, this mouse seems to have wide appeal despite it's large size.I have not personally owned the G602 before, or any other wireless Logitech product for that matter.  I owned the G600, but that mouse is in a completely different size and functional category!  Despite needing a battery and is wireless, the G604 felt less dense and heavy than my old G502 (which my mother swears by).As previously stated, the performance on this mouse is stellar while using a DPI setting of 1250 for general use/gaming.  There has been no drop outs in movement or jitters as with the corsair counterparts.  Logitech does not disappoint.The most recent Logitech comparison I could make is with the g403.. Which IMO is an amazing mouse, and had to use time-to-time when in between the corsair mice.Wires are too annoying for me on my mice.  I honestly loved my mm710 dearly, and hope to find it a new home soon (coolermaster 53g super light mouse).Overall, I suggest that if able, to try the G604 before you buy.. you won't regret it!","November 3, 2020",5

Nicholas,"The mouse itself is gone, but the damn double click issue kills it.","I've had this mouse for about a year, and 6 months in, the double click issue started happening, I die more often from the mouse refusing to acknowledge that I'm HOLDING the left mouse button down and treating it like a double click. I won't be wasting my money on this mouse again as the issue will undoubtedly happen to a new one.","September 4, 2022",1

L. Sanchez,A pretty good middle-ground between gaming and productivity,"I am genuinely in love with the Logitech G604 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse it meets both my criteria as a gamer and as a web-developer.Let's talk about the game aspect first. The new Hero 16k sensor is by far one of the most accurate sensors that I have ever used. Hands down it just makes aiming that much better, I am an Overwatch player, and when I switched to the G604 mouse with the Hero 16k sensor I noticed it right away, it feels so natural to aim. It can detect the slightest movements in your mouse. It's quite scary because it makes it feel like an extension to my hands.As for the customisation, the Logitech G HUB does a fantastic job giving you full control on what you want to program on your buttons. At first, it was a bit tricky to use, but I got the hang of it, and I like the now G HUB, The buttons on the mouse can be customised into anything, so this makes it an excellent MMO mouse or any FFS that uses skills like overwatch, genuinely incredible.Now onto my web-developer, I cannot describe the amount of time this mouse has saved me when coding, I have customised every button to perform different task like duplicating lines and even templates for my coding. This mouse is a perfect solution for many web developers out there. The fact that you can have custom key presses can make a significant difference in how fast you can finish coding and editing.Another convenient factor is that I can switch between devices. I always have both my desktop and laptop on when I code and thanks to this mouse I only have to use one mouse to control both PCs, and that is additional time and space saved, thanks to the built-in Bluetooth and lightspeed controllers.The wireless dongle is excellent, it is very responsive, and I never had any issues with it, I have always trusted Logitech with their wireless peripherals, it just works, period.Overall I think this mouse is great, the price is not bad, and you get a lot in return like the Hero 16k sensor and the long-lasting battery.Highly recommend it if you need more buttons for your intense gaming sessions.","November 9, 2019",5

He loves the programmable buttons on the side. You can program them to do things on your computer but also to do shortcuts in any game you are playing.He says it is light weight and has a long battery life.He does wish there was an battery life indicator on the mouse but he does not mind it that much since the battery lasts for a while.,"February 4, 2020",4
Elle,Could use some design tweaks,"I’m not too happy with this mouse for a few reasons. The shape is okay but not ideal for me. I appreciate all the extra buttons and their great placement - you can program each for different commands and function for gaming or software use and save different setting profiles for different games. I would like it a lot more if it had a similar resting pad for my pinkie and right ring finger to sit as it has for my thumb, since without it, my pinkie just sort of drags along my mousepad or I have to keep it pressed against the mouse which causes fatigue with extended use.My major complaint would be the scroll wheel. I’m not sure if there’s something I’m missing but the scroll is super jumpy and every other time I scroll down, it will “jump” back up a bit which messes me up. I’ve tried changing the scroll settings but I haven’t come across a fix or figured out why I’m having this particular problem. If anyone could give some insight, I’d appreciate it!I’m not impressed with the battery compartment either, as it’s basically just a flimsy and loosely fitted hatch that you lift up easily. It doesn’t lock into place or feel very secure – it seems cheap to me considering the price. It takes an AA battery which comes included but I think most people would be just as satisfied with a AAA battery instead.All the command/function buttons are easy to reach to trigger actions or switch DPI and you can customize the functions attached to each button for your own gaming style preference depending on the game you’re playing. I didn’t experience any lag, even when using it with Bluetooth connection to my laptop. That’s something that’s pretty cool – you can swap connection between your PC and laptop seamlessly!","November 5, 2019",3
Krm,Great mouse for hardcore gamer,"This mouse is pretty much excellent in every way. I don't think I'll ever use all 15 programmable buttons but the few I do use are super handy. The mouse is incredibly comfortable, super accurate, and I've had no problem with battery life yet. My biggest problem is that you can buy a very similar mouse from an off brand for half the price. That being said if you're a handcore gamer this would be a great mouse for you","December 20, 2019",4
J Spig,"Gaming, browsing, and everything else","With 15 programmable controls, this is pretty much everything you need in a mouse.  It also has super low latency (1ms with Lightspeed) so it is very accurate and lightweight to boot.  After trying it out for an extended period, I found it very comfortable and my hand did not get tired at all.  The battery life is phenomenal at a rated 240 hours with Lightspeed, so it will be quite a while before you need to replace the single AA which comes included.  The G-suite software works well (PC and MAC), but it does have a bit of a learning curve and can be a little “glitchy” at times.  Not really a major negative as this can be fixed in a future update.  Still, it could be a little more user friendly to use.  It is nice that you can pair this with Bluetooth and Lightspeed so you can switch back and forth between the two depending on your needs (office/browsing/gaming).  I also have to mention the metal scroll wheel that can be changed with a click of a button on the mouse.  You can go from endless/hyper scrolling to page scrolling with a quick click of a button.  Great design!Overall, I am really happy with this mouse and even when I use it for non-gaming purposes it works great.  Basically, you don’t need to be a gamer to purchase this product.  If you do any type of extended work with spreadsheets, documents, etc. you will like this mouse.  Of course you will get more out of it if you are a gamer, but this is not a requirement.  Other than my minor gripe about the software, this is a great choice and should be at the top of your list if you are looking for a new mouse.Recommended!Good luck with your decision/purchase.","November 13, 2019",5

TorontoniAnn,Impressive - Logitech G604 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse,"I've used Logitech products for years, but the release of the Lightspeed gaming series has stepped things up. I've had the chance to use the gaming keyboard, and the G604 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse. Both are now fixtures on the household laptop, for use by all for various applications, including gaming.The first step is to download the G-Hub software. It's easy to find via a Google search. After the quick installation, it's really quite intuitive - the software instantly recognizes what you have plugged into your computer. A press of the button allows you to start configuring things right away. Logitech's engineers have clearly spent a lot of time deciding what features might make for useful or helpful customization, and you can assign any number of commands to the mouse (and the keyboard, sold separately of course) by utilizing the drag-n-drop menu on the left of the screen. I could go on and on about the myriad available macros, commands, etc. - but I suggest you get in there for yourself and decide which features you will best use and enjoy. It's a lot of fun to play with.The mouse has a lightening-fast response time and it's everything you'd hoped it would be for gaming purposes. As a daily-use mouse, however, it is not going to be at the top of the list for a household where multiple parties use it. Simply put, it's just too heavy. It's cumbersome to move around and the very sturdiness and precision that makes it an excellent gaming mouse, makes it a bit challenging to use for more quotidien endeavours. I see the 'old' regular Logitech wireless mouse being temporarily put back into rotation sometimes, given it's lighter and simpler to use.On the whole, however, this is hands-down a super-impressive mouse. It's on the pricey side, but it's a premium product all the way.","January 5, 2020",5

Heather,Too lightweight and not very comfortable,"The Lightspeed gaming mouse is a fairly okay gaming mouse that allows for a lot of button customization. It is fast and precise, but it just didn't cut it for me.The Lightspeed is a very lightweight mouse. My current (wired) mouse also comes in at the lighter end of the scale, but the Lightspeed is significantly lighter and that takes a lot of getting used to.I like that you can actually pair the mouse with two different computers, one using Bluetooth and one using Lightspeed. Not many people will find this useful, but if you regularly use two different computers this is a nice touch.You will need to use the G Hub app to configure all the keys. This is not a good app. It is slow, confusing, and annoying. It has gotten better in the past several months, so hopefully it will continue to improve. And, at least once you get your key settings to your liking, you won't need to fuss in the app again.I didn't find this mouse to be very comfortable. Now, to be fair, I am a small woman with small hands, so that may have something to do with it. But, I find my large Corsair mouse, with its changeable thumb rest, to be orders of magnitude more comfortable to use over prolong periods of time.Overall, while this is a nice fast mouse with good response times and tons of programmable buttons, it is just too light and too uncomfortable for me.","November 12, 2019",3
Amber ,not bad,"its a nice mouse.  the LMB though is iffy.  I thought that was just the way it was supposed to be and I would get used to it, but it double clicks a lot and doesn't hold very well.  can be frustrating trying to drag a window or do something in a game.  other than that the rest of it is great.","June 18, 2021",3
Andrew,Packed full of features,"This really is a full featured gaming mouse. It has a ton of programmable buttons, option to switch the mode of the scroll wheel from free spinning to ratcheting at a click of a button on the mouse, and the mouse can connect via bluetooth or use Logitech's Lightspeed connector. The bluetooth connection is better on battery life though.The mouse runs on a single AA battery, so it's very easy to keep it up an running, no proprietary batteries or charging required. The response is incredible accurate and fast. The ergonomics of the mouse are comfortable, but for my hands I would have preferred a slightly larger mouse, for reference I usually wear medium sized gloves.My one and only gripe about this mouse is the software, the Logitech G Hub has improved over time but is still horrible to use, much of the time it doesn't properly detect the mouse and I can't rely on it to change the settings on the mouse. Thankfully, once you do have everything setup the mouse works like a charm.","October 7, 2020",3

Diana,Best Mouse I Ever Had,"I have been using the Logitech G502 for a year now and loved it. So I thought this would be better and I have to say it is. For the most part it is the same as my 502 but everything has been refined a bit more.First of all the battery power on this one is almost unbelievable. Don’t know how many times I have left it on all day or over night and I haven’t had to recharge it in approximately 4 weeks now.It comes with balancing weights but I don’t need to use them as it has a super glide action as well as it’s extremely comfortable to use. The fit to my hand for me is perfect and hasn’t as of yet caused any strain no matter how long I am using it. The curve of my hand is natural and relaxed which is a bonus for anyone needing precision and speed.It has numerous buttons that can be set manually for all your needs depending on the game you are playing or work you are doing. The app for this mouse is very easy to navigate while customizing your mouse for the buttons and lights if you are into the lights that is.What I like about this G604 is you don’t have 5 to 10 seconds before the mouse starts up from stand by while the program is reactivating. The 604 goes into action right away.  I didn’t need to upgrade to the G604 from my 502, but it’s a nice improvement that I am happy I have.","February 6, 2020",5
cornfedpig,Can't customize without 64-bit only software,"I wanted this mouse to be awesome, because I have been using Logitech products for a long time and they have all impressed me. This looks like an amazing mouse that would be a good addition to any gaming rig, but sadly the software required to customize the mouse and all its extra features requires a 64-bit machine, and I only have a 32-bit machine, so I could not install the G Hub software. That's was very disappointing.The mouse does feel good in your hands, and is extremely accurate. It's got good sensitivity and tracks very well. You can adjust the scroll wheel to be rather or smooth depending on your preference. It's lightweight, and feels a little cheap when you take go the cover of the battery compartment. The rest of the body feels solid.I'm sure this would be awesome to program macros and whatnot onto the different buttons, but without running the G Hub software this is no more than a normal mouse. For the price, it's not worth it unless you have a 64-bit system.","November 8, 2019",3

Leo,"Decent mouse, but there are better options for gaming","I've been playing Counter Strike for as long as I remember, and I needed a new mouse as my old SteelSeries Rival was acting up on me. I decided to go for something different, and I kind of regret that decision. On paper, the G502 is a solid mouse. Good build quality, sleek, highly customizable with a bunch of features. But the mouse just has too much junk on it. You pretty much have to hold it in a very specific position to not accidentally press any of the buttons. Its wayyy too easy to accidentally click on the aim or DPI buttons which makes it extremely annoying to use for competitive fps games, especially when you constantly have to half pay attention to how you hold your mouse. Maybe it's better for people with smaller hands, but I can't really recommend it if you're gonna do any serious gaming with it.","October 15, 2020",3
Luke,"Very Responsive, High-Quality Mouse, With Lot's of Customization","The Logitech G604 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse with Hero 16K Sensor is a gamer's dream. It's incredibly fast and responsive with absolutely zero lag across any game or application you throw at it. It's got an 15 programmable buttons so it's great for MMO and MOBA  players. The buttons can be programmed for different apps like Word, Excel, Photoshop etc. The feel of the mouse is very comfortable and high-quality. It's as though it's made to fit like a glove on your hand. It fits so good in my own hand, which is on the smaller side.It feels much more ergonomic than my wireless Logitech M185. Of course, being a high-end mouse, all the buttons are totally customizable through the app.I also like how clicky and tactile the mouse it. The rubberized grip feels great. The wheel feels like it's heavy-duty and super pleasant to use on websites. However, the Logitech G-Hub app to do this seems a little bit cluttered for my taste. Logitech should make the app more streamlined. It's also on the heavy side. The battery life seems to be very good, from what I read. It's supposed to be 240+ hours on a single AA, which is crazy good. I have used this mouse exclusively and heavily for over a month with zero battery issues so far and expect a much longer battery life to come.  Overall, this is a very good gaming mouse, with industry-leading performance, that serious gamers will definitely want to get their hands on. Full marks from me.","November 29, 2019",5

I liked this mice for its comfort and added weights felt awesome however at the time of this review in the same week my left and right button started malfunctioning ; both of em do not want to ""stick"" anymore and it affects my gaming experience hell of a lot. I was disappointed because before this mouse I had a G.SKILL MX-780 Which I loved a lot , and that mouse lasted me 4 years while this one only 1.

alexandre,The best there is,"I have used maybe 4 brands of gaming mice, when my G502 was munched on by my dog because it fell to the ground and my dog taught hey fun ! i whent with corsair wich i had used and liked in the past,but i got the glave and i DO NOT recommend your thumb slides so easily to the ''back'' button it got annoying real fast and the feel wasnt great either,so i went back to this , its comfortable,the weight can be changed depending if you want a heavier mouse or lighter one,clicks as fast as you can ... its the mouse you want and if it somehow get broken like mine or gets used so much you have no choice but to buy a new like i have in the past go with the G502 you wont go wrong with !","August 12, 2020",5
SCANNERMAN,SOMETHING YA'LL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT LOGITECH,"They're not the same company they used to be. I've been a Logitech user since 1999. I've read through these reviews and I'm seeing constant complaints about the contacts on this model not functioning correctly and the mouse having double click issues. Well, this is not the only Logitech mouse that has this problem. I have a Prodigy model and I'm encountering the same issue with it. I did some research on this issue and used all the trouble shooters I could find short of dismantling the mouse and voiding the warranty to no avail. In the process of trying to resolve the issue myself instead of immediately demanding a refund the warranty had expired on the mouse.You see, I thought perhaps it might have been a firmware issue. Someone here mentioned G HUB like it's a good thing. I challenge you to have a close look at how deep G HUB sinks its hooks into your registry. I don't think G HUB is a good thing at all. In fact, G HUB is pretty invasive.Just based on reading the reviews here I can so relate to the frustration and I feel entitled after owning so many Logitech mouses and Logitech products to bring something to the attention of Logitech users. Overall rating can't be much when your mouse is constantly dbl clicking. Your gaming experience is going to suffer dramatically. Ergonomics are out the window with your comfort when you're stressed out because your mouse won't function correctly.I contacted Logitech about this issue and the best they would offer me was a 30% off coupon to buy another logitech mouse. They didn't even have the decency to offer to replace the product and they know I'm a registered product user with a Logitech account with a family of 5 all using Logitech products. Yeah. That's the best that selfish company can do. People there are better companies out there. Whoever is running Logitech now isn't the same good old boys that actually honoured their hardware. *BUYER BEWARE* You're only paying for a name. The quality isn't there anymore.","March 19, 2022",1
mdkxp,"Good, but not for me","I'm not a mouse user. It's been close to 20 years since I switched to using Logitech trackball devices exclusively (the thumb kind). The reason is that mice - every single one I've ever tried - hurt my hand. My ring and pinky fingers hang off the sides and it just ends up in a lot of pain, I guess carpal tunnel syndrome? I don't know. But the Trackman devices don't do this to me, as my full hand is supported.This mouse looked big, so I thought I'd try it. I like the performance of it using the included USB dongle, and how you can easily switch the sensitivity. This would make for a nice feature in gaming or photo editing, perhaps. I also liked that the scroll wheel can be freely spun; I wish my Trackman had these features. Other than that, the mouse was fine, but it didn't solve my hand pain issue, unfortunately.If you're a gamer, this seems a nice device. I'd recommend it for anyone who doesn't suffer in pain with mice like I do.","December 4, 2019",3
Eidalan,"Amazing, but only lasted a little over a year","This mouse is really amazing. I love everything about it. Recently I've started having problems with my scroll wheel not working, or working intermittently. It eventually cut out all-together. Shortly after the right click started acting weird. It doesn't always allow me to hold it down. It keeps trying to click and reclick even though it's being held. When FPS gaming this pretty much spams ADS/Hipfire non-stop. It makes competing at any level impossible. I'm now in the market for a new mouse, and as much as I love this one, I don't know if it's worth the cost.Logitech promises 50 million clicks, and there's no way I've got that from my right click.It's a great mouse if you don't mind buying a new one every year or so.","May 26, 2020",3
Cody,Overall it was a great mouse for about 1 year.,"Around the 1 year mark of ownership, I got the dreaded double left click issue. It went from never doing it, to doing it over 50% of the time. It has become very frustrating and I will be replacing with a different model. Was great in the year it worked.","February 23, 2021",3
Amazon Customer,"BROKE IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR - listen to enthusiast reviews, not internet hype","                    The media could not be loaded.                 After having issues with my Corsair M65 FPS Mouse (broken weight holder; inconsistent middle-click), I decided to give the Hero G502 a shot since it has been regarded as being one of the best gaming mice for quite some time now.However, I hate to say that the hype is not fully justified. Just 3 days short of the 1-year mark of using this mouse, the right-mouse button no longer works: clicking & holding the RMB will often register as several erratic clicks, which makes this mouse a paperweight.+ Large & long mouse, which is great if you have large hands+ The scroll wheel is S-tier: the discrete scrolling mode is very clicky; the continuous scrolling mode is very smooth- Bad switches: right-click is useless just shy of 1 year after purchase- Entirely plastic construction: build quality feels second-rate compared to competing metal-frame mice in the same price range (e.g. Corsair M65). Feels like the budget used to put RGB and fancy molds/styling in the mouse would be better off put into better build quality & switches instead- Software does the job but doesn't work sometimes. Is less feature-rich and customizable than Corsair's iCUE software.In summary: The G502 Hero COULD be an excellent mouse, but it is overshadowed by mediocre build quality and bad switches. I'd recommend buying a metal-frame mouse from a different brand that has good reviews on an enthusist-focused site like Newegg or Memoryexpress (NOT Amazon). However, if you INSIST on buying a Hero G502, buy it dirt-cheap and be ready to make a warranty claim....I've taken my Corsair M65 out of storage after all this time; I'll take a solid aluminum mouse with an inconsistent middle-click over the Hero G502 any day.","November 27, 2020",2

Joe,"Very comfortable, exceeded my expectations!","Most of my computer accessories are Logitech. Why? Simply because they're made very well, they function very well, and they look great. This new G604 is no exception. As soon as you put your hand on it you'll see what I mean. It's the most comfortable mouse I've used, super ergonomic! The buttons are all very accessible, it slides on my desk very easily, and with the ability to last 240 hours with only 1 AA battery, it's very practical!I also have a Logitech G502 gaming mouse. Both are similar in price, but this mouse has a much much longer battery life and it is more comfortable (for bigger hands). Where it lacks is there is no RGB LED lighting. Not a deal breaker for most, but some will want that. It also doesn't have the adjustable weight like the G502.If you want a very high quality gaming mouse that you don't need to worry about keeping charged, this is the mouse for you!","November 5, 2019",5
Nicholas,Quality Control issues with this mouse! (Double Clicking/ Tracking lazer),"To start off this review I wanna make it clear that I have owned three of these mice, all three eventually failed to the same issues. The G502 is a absolute trash mouse, I hope after reading this review you reconsider your purchase of Logitech G502. in the course of 2 years I have gone threw three of them all succumbing to double clicking/bad tracking laser. this mouse seems built to fail and for the price point its at I think they fail a little to quick to be worth the purchase. the first 3 months of this mouse I was really impressed then they just start to fail. The reason i kept purchasing this mouse and I'm a Logitech fan boy. but from this point on I'm no longer going to purchase their gear. The Artemins is another thing to avoid just an FYI.More Information. The double clicking is sometimes solved according to online fixes but i have tried them all and with no results. The laser is just very fragile and sensitive to hair and dust. make sure you have compressed air and no cats.","January 11, 2021",2
Valkyrie Orion,Comfy with flaws,"Mouse is quite comfortable, I like the angle it is on for right handed users and I find it puts less tensions on my shoulder. The scroll wheel is nice in that it uses the infinite scroll option, however it makes a rattle noise that I found annoying. Bluetooth connection was terrible. It would connect and disconnect every 20 seconds or so. I did not try the 2.4 Ghz adapter as I only was using Bluetooth.","September 14, 2020",3
Ben,Remarkable mouse for the price!,"Perhaps the greatest mouse I’ve used, ever, the thing that impresses me more than anything here is how complete this package is. Forget just gaming, this thing is a productivity beast with exceptional ergonomics, button mapping, and EXTREMELY accurate cursor control, the point where in Photoshop you can basically select pixels at a pretty zoomed out view. And the battery life is insane—after using this for about 3 weeks, I’m still at 95%... if that isn’t crazy, it’s the fact a quick battery swap is all you need to continue working.For the price, you aren’t just getting a nice mouse, you’re petty much getting the finest mouse out there with exceptional build quality and LG’s outstanding customer service!","December 13, 2019",5

GT Dude,Feature -Full Gaming Mouse,"The Logitech G604 Gaming Mouse use a great mouse for any gamer looking for a fairly priced but function packed gaming mouse. It comes with 15 programmable buttons that can be programmed through Logitechs g-hub software. Inside the box you will find a dongle (inside the rear compartment of the mouse), a dongle extension, and a single AA battery. The LightSpeed mode gives you the fastest possible wireless connection so you can get optimum performance from the mouse. You can also use the Bluetooth mode on the mouse if you wish to connect to multiple devices. The left & right click and scroll all feel natural to the touch. Overall the mouse fits ergonomically in your hand and has a long battery life, great for any intense gamers.","November 4, 2019",5
Kris B.,Not a good mouse for normal use,"This mouse is decent, and probably great for gaming, however for day-to-day use, it isn't comfortable or useful.

Amber,Doesn't last long,"The second gaming mouse I've had from Logitech ending up to have the clicking/double clicking issue which is ENORMOUSLY annoying for gaming, or even just for everyday use. It's now completely unusable for gaming due to the clicking issue, and I don't think I've even had the mouse longer than 2 years. It is good weight, and has a lot of customizable side buttons, but just the clicking issue for the second time for logitech brand gaming mice.","February 2, 2021",2
Nathan,Do Not Buy - already broken,"This mouse is a nice high-end mouse, that stopped working within 10 months (cant remember exactly when I bought it). Don't buy it.The main issue is that very often, the left click will now double click and not hold (so when trying to drag a window you click instead for example). Also often just clicking will result in a double click. This ruins everything.Furthermore, the scroll wheel will miss some inputs occasionally.One nitpick is that you can't use the extra buttons on the mouse unless you bind them to a key via Logitech's software. So thats just them trying to install customer metric collecting software. And since there is no software for Linux, Linux users just... dont get to use those buttons.","February 5, 2021",2
Jiwenapekin,Feels a little light ...,"Great product, switching between laptops is very easy.

I bought my mouse back in March 2019 and the right-click button has already lost its spring-like response. Can't game with it anymore. The left-click is fine so I'm assuming the issue is over-usage (most games involve intense right-clicking), but my other mouses in the past began experiencing this problem after 4+ yrs of usage.This thing was not meant to last... Definitely stay away if you're a serious gamer.","September 15, 2020",2

My left-click is entirely unusable despite about 4 months of non-consistent use. I initially had the mouse replaced but the same issues arose after another month. While I play lots of PC games, I am certainly not a ""heavy gamer"" and have not put the G502 through any unintended or excessive use.

David S.,Worst mouse I have EVER used!,"First of all I bought this on the Amazon sale, secondly the mouse feel very cheap in the hands, very plastically, what made me to decide on returning the mouse was the lagging problem, in Bluetooth mode the mouse pointer ran like 10fps across the screen making it un-useable, the lightspeed mode there were times it would lag on one spot of the screen then move again, this happened a lot. Then there's the all metal scroll wheel, which has zero grip, you could be gently scrolling the wheel with your finger but it doesn't move. The metal wheel and the lagging mouse pointer are two MASSIVE RED FLAGS of avoidance. I should have bought a Corsair mouse instead. This is pure trash.","October 15, 2020",1

This is supposed to be a replacement for the previous model of G500 which was actually very good, so they decided to replace it with a cheaper model that does not work as promised.  Also, previous model had more options to program the marco keys.  Programmable button (macro) here is limited and basically useless.VERY DISAPPOINTING, would give 0 starts if I can.","July 6, 2020",1
Customer,Do not waste your money - comes with a manufacturing defect that kills clicks,"As most other reviews have mentioned, the G502 comes with a terribly manufacturing defect that causes random double clicks, or holds/clicks that release at random.On the bright side, customer support was great at sending replacements while under warranty - each of which has had the exact same defect.

Leon,This is a very poorly designed and made product.,"Edit: if I could give this zero stars I would. It's now completely useless as it constantly double clicks. It's cheap plastic garbage. Probably costs Logitech 5$ to make. Everything about it is low quality. It's disgusting that there are so many blatantly fake reviews for this garbage.Edit: Changed from two stars to one star. My initial review was negative, but it's just significantly worse now. I've been using this mouse for about six months now. My initial impression was 100% accurate, it's a cheap piece of planned obsolescence. The DPI settings require you to have Logitechs software installed, which I dislike, but the icing on the cake is the software doesn't work consistently. Sometimes I'll start up my PC and my DPI sensitivty settings for the mouse will be completely out of whack. I'll restart the Logitech software but nothing changes, I have to restart my computer for the proper DPI settings to register. The piece of plastic that hides the batteries is consistently loose, as I described in my initial review it doesn't clip into place and instead kind of just sits there, I have more than one time had that piece of plastic fall off simply from ordinary mouse use. Then on top of all that, if I'm holding down the left mouse button and tapping my right mouse button at the same time there's this awful plastic noise that sounds like the mouse is being pried apart and ready to break. This is by far the most expensive cheap piece of planned obsolescence that I've ever seen. Over 100$ for what should in all seriousness be a 20$ unit. I bought a off brand mouse off Amazon to replace this ""brand named AAA product"". I'll never give Logitech another cent. This is like the fifth and final straw for me.  I've had serious issues with every single one of their products that I've bought over the past decade, and I've been a customer of theirs for well over twenty years.Original review: I used the previous version, the G602 I believe. Solid mouse, albeit it had serious issues. ( I had to return two of them via Logitechs website. ) I needed a new mouse with more side buttons and figured I'd go with this.To sum up my experience, I'm never buying a Logitech product again. This is by far the cheapest mouse I've ever held. It feels like a 20$ mouse with some extra side buttons.It's not even designed well, if you move in one direction quickly with the mouse it wants to leave the surface of the mousepad, it leans upward because there are four pads on it for stabilizing it, but they're so thin that again if you're moving in one direction quickly it wants to flip upward.Beyond that the back case that holds the battery in doesn't even clip into place. It just sits there basically. I've never had a battery case like this on any serious product, ever. Most fasten into place with a bit of pressure and clip in. This kind of just sits there, and if you move the mouse the wrong way you can feel the plastic hiding the batteries move.I just ""upgraded"" from a cheap no name 25$ mouse on Amazon and it actually felt better to me. I'd still be using it if I didn't need these extra side buttons-- but this Logitech mouse is a cheap POS and it will not last any meaningful amount of time. I'm amazed.I've been going with Logitech for over twenty years now, and my last several purchases from them have been terrible. The G710+ Keyboard I needed to return, the G602 Mouse I had to return twice. One of their headsets also returned. It's a joke. They used to be good quality and now they're just getting by on their name peddling trash products at a premium because people like me grew up on their products and trust them. The only thing positive I can say about them is that their return policy is pretty decent-- but then it would need to be considering my personal experiences with their products failure rates. The thing is, when I buy a product I don't want the experience to involve me bringing it home or waiting a week for delivery, then realizing it's broken and sending it out and waiting for another to show up.There's really no point going with Logitech over literally any no name brand product on the Net. They're that cheaply made these days.","January 23, 2021",1
MoonShyne ,Amazing mouse and excellent customer service!,"I ordered this for my sons gaming computer. It was something he’d wanted for awhile and I gave in and bought it. The first one came quickly but unfortunately it was D.O.A., the spinning wheel (pardon my lack of technical lingo lol) was not working and I called Amazon about the issue. They issued a replacement right away and the next day we got it and my son is THRILLED with it! He loves this mouse and is raving about all the cool features it has. It’s VERY comfortable to use. I’d say anyone would love this mouse. It’s an amazing mouse and thanks to Amazons fantastic customer service my son is loving his new mouse. Thank you!","January 26, 2022",5
Sean,Nice quality of life improvements to G602,"The mouse is slightly lighter than the G602 (my previous favorite) and the 6 raised mouse buttons on the left side are slightly easier to individually identify. The feel remains largely the same, other than the option to use infinite scrolling (or not) which some people swear by; it's nice to have the option one way or the other anyways.It seems like a very nice upgrade - I'll report back if I develop any double click issues, otherwise consider the mouse and the review to be current.","July 16, 2022",5
Real Person,great (again)!,"Follow-up to original review (second paragraph below, beneath the dotted lines): I am very pleased to report that a second, very vigorous use of compressed air on every button and opening I could see on the mouse has restored it to its former glory (my initial attempt with compressed air focussed only on the offending primary button; but a Youtube video convinced me to blast *every* button and opening, including the wheel, with air). I never did get very far into the warranty process since I fixed the mouse within a few hours of making contact with Logitech, but they did contact me the following day and it did appear that they were going to be helpful. So I must emphasize that I am (once again) very happy with this mouse. I am sorry to read that others have genuine double-clicking issues with this mouse, but I cannot (presently) count myself among them.-----------------------------------Purchased in March 2021; by March 2022 (slightly more than a year later) it has developed a double-click issue with the primary (left) click button. I have gone through all the suggested fixes (that don't involve soldering) I could find on the internet; none worked. I am now going through the warranty process to see if I can get a replacement (a refund is, I suppose, too much to hope for).","March 30, 2022",5
Erwin Van Den Broecke,"Smooth operation, very quiet left and right click buttons","Compared to the much less expensive mouse I bought approximately a year ago, this new Logitech mouse has a much smoother movement and the left and right clicks are so quiet I can't hear them at all, unlike the UTechSmart Venus Plus mouse mentioned above.","July 15, 2022",5

brain,It`s NOT a wireless G600,"I should mention I don`t use gaming mice for gaming, but for 3D architectural design, so I find programmable buttons more important than anything else. This said I was under the impression that the mouse was basically a wireless G604, but it`s just not. Its listed as having 15 programmable buttons, but nope its only 13, the stupid dpi and bluetooth buttons are fixed (idc for either of these), and that`s including the clicks and scroll wheel. It is nowhere CLOSE to 28+ buttons (counting G shift) that the wired G600 has, but maybe I`m a small portion of the market I`m not sure (Ive seen other reviews from my profession though)","September 26, 2022",1

Mary Reddekopp,Awesome gaming mouse!,"The Logitech G502 HERO is one of my personal favorite gaming mouse's. It has a great price. It was super easy to set up with the Logitech software. Software is simple and easy to use for macro's, lighting and DPI. Note the software will try to automatically install on your computer when you plug it in. All 11 programmable buttons work perfectly. This mouse has a super clean design. The weight is great, not to heavy and not to light for me. There is weights you can take out at the bottom of the mouse. This mouse goes up to 25,600 DPI. I recommend this mouse for FPS and many other video games. This mouse can be used on Xbox, some games are compatible with keyboard and mouse on Xbox. Overall this mouse is awesome. I recommend this mouse and I have had no problems with this mouse. I had this mouse for almost a year. The performance has always stayed the same with this mouse. Awesome mouse!","November 22, 2021",5
Charles Gill,G602 Reborn.,"Ok if you like the shape and feel and button layout of the g602 well this is the exact same thing upgraded. The protruding feet on the bottom of this mouse i figured would cause an issue when i use on soft surfaces ... nope it works fine. The range of this mouse nobody seemed to mention anywhere. I loved my g602 had huge range i could carry it 3 rooms away and it still worked. Well the g604 does the same thing and is more responsive and uses less batteries. Yes less than the g602. This new sensor is good. Range is great. Feels identical to the g602 but lighter weight (one battery only). Now onto the scroll wheel i still have mixed feelings. The free scroll wheel works great and i use it all the time but its SUPER touchy, which makes it difficult to get used to. Im sure as time goes on ill get better at it. When you turn the scroll wheel off now its way too slow (recommend adjusting settings on your operating system mouse wheel settings).. Also this mouse will backup as a Bluetooth mouse. Well now i can sell my backup Bluetooth mouse because I have this. Also I might add i watched a bunch of reviews on this mouse prior to purchasing. Many said the scroll wheel is loud., i just wanted to address this. Sure this mosue's scroll whele is somewhat loud if you jiggle it vigorously back and forth. In reality, I cant think of one time I have ever needed to shake my mouse like that ever.. So not sure why someone would focus on that.Overall i love this mouse, and will probably buy a second once the price falls a bit.I really use and love the free scrolling more than i thought i would. Just buy it.","July 30, 2020",5

Brennan Camaganacan,Amazing for my productivity,"Being a non gamer and using this mouse specifically for productivity has been a game changer for me, some of the features I have programmed with my mouse include the ability to cycle applications, increase and decrease the sound on media, switch tabs in Firefox, pause media, and most importantly copy and paste documentation.Coming from an aspiring network engineer, the ability to scroll to the bottom of documentation or a running configuration is VERY helpful.In regards to re activeness, I am currently not using a mat (the next thing to add to my home setup) and can navigate fine.The battery life on the mouse has been phenomenal, I have not changed it from the battery provided by Logitech and have been using this mouse everyday for the past 3 months.NegativesI bought this mouse for full price off of Best Buy and it was over 120, which is a bit overpriced in my opinion, but hey this mouse has been a game changer for me and my productivity so I'm fine with it.","February 16, 2021",5

Luke P.,Familiar but better EDIT NEW VERSION,"Had to get a new g502 because my OG proteus core right click became loose and I broke it trying to fix it myself, and found a barely used one on a good deal. got it for $70 and well worth it to keep what I loved about my original mouse and a few nice upgrades - noticeable RGB colours, better sensor, better braided cable and the scroll wheel feels a lot better. The scroll wheel click feels a lot nicer.EDIT: My old mouse left click stopped working properly and the scroll wheel had sunken in to where it would middle click while scrolling so I bought this again - The new version does not have a braided cord as it has for many years now which was very disappointing.","August 7, 2019",4
Selina L,"Good hardware, bad software","The mouse is great. I bought this sometime in the summer of 2021 and have been using it ever since. I use it with all of the weights out. Even with all the weights out its still a pretty hefty mouse compared to some other gaming mice.This review would be a 5/5 if the software didn't have so many issues. It would often auto update even when I disabled auto updates, which would then have a 1/2 chance to either freeze the program on the loading screen indefinitely or successfully update and wipe all of my profiles. I haven't had issues in months because I opted to install an older version of it and deleted the updates.exe so that it literally cannot auto update, but the software was a huge pain to work with in the beginning and I expect that many others would have similar issues before finding a solution.","October 13, 2022",4
