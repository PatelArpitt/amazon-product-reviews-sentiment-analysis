Amazon Customer,Love it!,"I love this product! It’s cute and fun for someone who’s casually nerdy like me! It lights up, makes clicky sounds (the nice sounds that make it fun to keep clicking hehe) works great with all the games I play and the mouse is great too ! I have carpal tunnel and it works great for the shorts periods of time I use it"

Amazon Customer,Love it!,"This product has been in my possession for 4 months now and still works like a charm. The keyboard has a very soft clicks to it that make very nice noises, it also very usefull to have the audio roller in the top corner makes turning volume up or don't easy, along with the RGB settings it quite nice and very custumisable. For the mouse I also find it to quite nice it glides nicely on the mouse pad I have and the clicks are also quite soft. The only down side I have for it would be you can have  the RGB on a sign color instead of it being rainbow. ( But if it is possible I retract that statement)Overall a good product and highly recommend to people who don't want to play an obscured amount of money for a good mouse and keyboard"
crystal,standard 2000's keyboard,"The keys are raised extremely high, makes for difficult typing, it truly has nothing ""gaming"" about it"".i dont like that there is no feature to change the lighting like all my other products, there's also no diming feature for the brightness in different setting.reminds me of the keyboards that were always in public libraries in the early 2000's."
Brent ruffo,Love it!,Cute
Jaime Mason,standard 2000's keyboard,Had torn through the package only to discover hardware that is circa 2010
emily,Love it!,"This keyboard and mouse duo was purchased to complete my pink setup (not so much for a high end gaming setup). Note that both devices need to be connected to USB 2.0 ports as they did not work with my 3.0 ports. I also wish the cords were braided or straightened out more. They're a bit of an eyesore, cheap and I'm concerned they won't last long but not so bad for the price.So far, they've both been performing well for me. I especially enjoy the numerous function keys on the keyboard to change up the colours! The keys sound like a brown switch, I think (not too clicky/mechanical sounding)."
Amazon Customer,standard 2000's keyboard,I’ve had this for about a year now and loved it at first. It works fine and the lights still work great and are very bright. The problem is within a few months the pink paint started coming off the keys. I never would have bought it if I knew this was going to happen. You get what you pay for I guess
Jessica,Love it!,Works good for a cheaper keyboard. Love the colours. The only thing is the the keys are a little loud when using them but it doesn’t bother me too much.
Ceetee,standard 2000's keyboard,Super nice gaming keyboard and mouse. I love the side buttons on the mouse for better gaming movement.
